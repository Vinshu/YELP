like a coffee shop and, in regards to cafe kopi, i got that \"i am going to like it here\" feeling as soon as i walked under the store front awnings and through the glass front door.  the lighting is just right, the music is a suitable volume and of a pleasant variety, and the staff were very friendly.  i ordered the iced cafe miel (a single shot latte with honey and vanilla) after reading some other yelpers reviews.  after talking with the barsta, she assured me that it was good both hot and cold.  i thoroughly enjoyed it as i read my book on this quiet sunday morning.  it was definitely a nice option for those that are not mocha lovers.i ca not speak to the food, but i can speak to the ambience.  it was a comfortable spot to read and get some work done and it is a place that i hope to

usually duck in for my drink and hit the road after so i ca not say much for the atmosphere long-term, but i love the warm environment that the cafe has laptop for a change of scenery.","a great

might well prefer kopi over the other also-great alternatives on the same block.","cafe kopi offers a good blend of drinks for its customers, a cozy environment, and abundant amount of space for sitting. however, i am on yelp and not here to describe how this is the perfect place for the sleep-deprived collegete - tasteless and very bland; in addition, it was presented in a tumbler. what kind of place would ever serve a latte in a tumbler? it was pretty difficult to consume the rest of my latte after a few sips. for the listed reasons, the latte was given zero stars.if you are looking for a place to study, then yes... this is probably the right place. if you are connoisseur of coffee, it is best to take your business elsewhere.","cafe kopi is ok.... i mean they have a great environment and well roasted beans but they just ca not get the prep right. they are far better than starbucks and espresso but not nearly as good as aroma cafe and cafe paradiso. at kopi a latte is espresso with warmed up milk, not steamed milk. the espresso is also not as good as it could be. i have bought their beans and made stuff at home. it turned out pretty well but every time i go there for a cup of coffee it tastes stale. i really do not know what they are doing back there.i do not think they have any idea how to make espresso beverages either. they have a grinder but it is manual and when manual grinders are used improperly they make horrible espresso... basically if you can get past the really really bad coffee then go here, but i ca not. if only we could combine aroma cafe and cafe

more than anything else, i love the character of the coffee shop with art exhibitions, with such a diverse set of customers, and such a warm environment. the coffee is good, the tea selection is very nice. the quality of the food is very good. unfortunately, the internet connection is not good and if you are a uiuc affiliated personnel and you want to connect to uiuc network using your vpn, it

cookie scones and i will be in paradise...","definitely the best coffee shop in the champaign-urbana area. the prices are reasonable, the music (at times) is decent, and the baristas for the most part are friendly. on top of this, they have consistent closing hours at midnight. the reason for four stars is that it can occasionally be a hit or miss on the quality of the prepared drink. also, the sandwich sizes are tiny given their price.","best chai latte in town, if not in the country ;d","cute place and great coffee. i ordered a latte with almond milk. very good! not many places offer

their chocolate for mochas are vegan!  every time i go there i make sure to get a mocha with soy because most places do not offer vegan chocolate!","definitely the best coffee shop in champaign-urbana. great coffee, plus you can get port and some other boozy drinks. the food is tasty, the decor is warm and cozy, and yeah, they have a doorway to circles next door. ok so the chairs are uncomfortable after a while, that is true. no couches to encourage settling in for the long haul. that is probably good for business though; nobody would ever leave otherwise.","easily the best espresso for at least a 100 mile radius. the coffee at kopi is wicked good. for coffee lovers, this is one of the few places in the mid-west (apart from soma in bloomington in) where they actually know how to both extract espresso correctly and heat the milk perfectly. depending on the barista you might even get some pretty foam/crema art action going on. love it.","cafe kopi is hands down my favorite coffee shop in the cu area. i cannot even count the number of times i have journeyed to kopi. my favorite thing to order in the winter is the gingerbread chai latte. it has the perfect combination of cinnamon, coffee, and gingerbread notes. in the summer i have iced tea. they only have two types of tea prepared (black and green), so if you want a tea from the wall, they have to brew it and pour it on ice. they have a pretty decent sandwich selection, so it is hard for me to choose which one i want. if you go there often, consider buying a kopi cup. you get discounts if you bring it in!the atmosphere is what really gets me. the wooden tables look rugged, but they are so smooth! there is local artwork on the walls that gives a \"hometown\" atmosphere. there is about 6 or 7 tables outside that you can sit at. i usually do not sit there because they are either taken or someone is smoking outside. if you do not have time to have a drink, peak your head inside cafe

caffeinated drinks. nice employees, clean bathrooms, a laid-back atmosphere--what more can you ask for?","great place for coffee and good studying!! or the other way around? whichever. anyway the coffee is great, i always get the cafe caramel in a to-go cup since it gets cold faster with the indoor mug. the taste is always good, sometimes a little strong, but nothing a little sugar could not fix. the environment varies ... sometimes it is nice, and sometime is it is not; it depends on the crowd. i had one occasion where some asian girl was sitting in front of me and kept talking to herself ... which was uhh hella weird. another instance had some girl in basically tight boxershorts showing off cellulite to the world like there is no tomorrow. and the most unforgettable one was where the place was packed and some smelly ass guy sat next to me. i had to get Meaning to in Short Message Service hours of studying done to prepare for the next day and i could not move and this guy

rice) to your car.","great place to get a variety of fresh authentic asian groceries. the meats and vegetables are pretty fresh but i would be cautious with their packaged sauces. taking a close a look at the ingredients before buying would help. i would avoid excessive amounts of monosodium glutamate (msg), and any suspicious artificial sweeteners or colors. far east also has a variety of other items that i could not identify, but i will have to say that they can clean up the place a bit, and the outside could also use a paint job, but i would not really worry about this affecting the food which is always stored and packaged well. they have a large walk in fridge and freezer at the back that they use to restock the display shelves. another minor complaint is that they only accept cash, but that is not that big of a deal since you would not buy too much at a time there. the cashiers are also really generous, they often round down the price so you do not have to go scrambling for loose change. the staff also let me exchange my rice when i picked up the wrong kind even without the receipt.","absolutely my favorite asian market in c-u. good for staples like big ol bags of rice and frozen dumplings as well as for stranger stuff like yellow bean paste and tamarind juice. the family who runs the store is always helpful when i need assistance navigating their packed aisles. the owner is vegan and she is been stocking more and more faux meat products which is awesome! their fresh food section has been getting better and better with each visit,h only, do not forget! and they look a little uninviting with the concrete exterior and tiny house-door but inside it is a wonder land.","i am from the mid-atlantic area (greater philadelphia) and this asian grocery store was adequate but not amazing. the cash-only policy is annoying, and the shelf organization is possibly the worst (as well as the narrowest) i have ever seen, including philly and nyc chinatowns. for example, why are frozen dumplings and frozen baozi in freezer cases on the opposite sides of the store? i also was not a huge fan of their frozen/prepared foods selection, which tends toward the sweet rather than the savory. it should not be this hard to find basic pork-and-vegetable steamed buns that can be reheated in the microwave. i also picked up a bottle of soy sauce at random and was later told by my mother that it was poor, for all these flaws, the store does serve my needs for asian-specific cooking ingredients and has a convenient location on my way home from work. the young woman who usually works at the cash register speaks perfect english and knows where everything is (nonsensically) located, which is a plus.","definitely not a restaurant, this little grocery store hides in an inconspicuous white building. i never would have known about it except through word of mouth.  while am-ko is better known and more polished, far east is the place where you go when you want an adventure. bizarre fruits, strange flavors, and interesting ingredients are abundant. i tend to shop blindly and end up with some winners like haw candy, which is made from a fruit that tastes like an apple crossed with cherries, and some losers, like the melon gourd drink that tasted like the sap from a swamp tree. this place is also known by daring college students for its frozen durian, which is a fruit famous for itseat: it is not an upscale specialty shop, some of it is somewhat dirty and the fruit is not always the freshest.","i admit that the grungy appearance of far east might deter most shoppers, especially as its window-less, brick exterior bears little resemblance to the welcoming storefront of most american grocery stores.  some other customers have accused the store of being \"dirty.\"  however, far east is not much different from the local markets in the chinatown areas of chicago, new york, los angeles, or other metropolitaner stores in town (e.g., amko, lee is market, green onion, etc.) specialize primarily in korean and japanese groceries, but far east offers cooking ingredients for other areas of asia.  the shop boasts an impressive selection of different noodles (not just ramen), fresh produce, beverages, and necessary sauces for cooking many malaysian, indonesian, thai, and chinese dishes.  where else in town can you find fresh lemon-grass, kaffir lime leaves, thai eggplants (golf-ball-size and green), and chinese leeks?some of the staff might seem hostile, but i would suggest approaching the teenagers who work there if you have trouble, as they are very friendly.  after describing dishes i want to cook, i have often received helpful and honest recommendations from the owners about the right ingredients to best time to pick up groceries at far east are thursday evenings or fridays because these are days when they receive fresh shipments of produce, bakery goods, and snacks.  sometimes they even have a box of live crabs available for adventurous eaters!","great place to get asian food!","asian grocery store in a super cramped building. they have got a good selection of canned, frozen, dried, and fresh chinese, korean, thai, and vietnamese foodstuffs. i was really surprised that they have fresh lemongrass, thai ginger, thai peppers, mushrooms (other than the plain american button ones), and greens.","far east is very close to my sister is apartment.  when i helped my parents move her in i said to them, \"what is with that creepy crack house back there? are you sure this is a safe street?\"  my sister nodded in agreement and gave a funny look.  my mom said \"it is an asian market, they probably have the best produce around.\"well, mom knows her stuff.  yes, it is creepy from the outside.  yes, it is a little weird smelling when you first walk in.  but the produce and authentic asian things are spot on.  i bought produce and drove it home to chicago.  that is how good ity also have all of the condiments your

superb quality, great taste. and the staff is super nice and helpful, definitely coming back!","although this shop is located in downtown champaign, it does not sit directly on the strip that gets the bulk of foot traffic, and thus it might be easily overlooked.  the first time i stopped in, i could not help but feel instinctively that this was one of those magical curiosity shops from my childhood books: all crowded aisles and dusty shelves piled to the ceiling with colorful primary product sold here is tea (of course), and they have got plenty of it in all brands, flavors, and forms.  thankfully, they carry traditional medicinals, a set of herbal teas that are invaluable for getting me through the cold/flu season.  many of the big brand teas (harrisons and crosfield, twinings, stash, republic of tea, etc.) are available in both loose-leaf and teabag form.  reluctant about paying $10 for a box of tea that you might not like?  you can make up your own variety pack by buying from their stock of individual tea bags (usually less than $0.50 per bag).  if you are a novice and just want to sample different kinds of tea, there is also the route of buying some of their self-serve bulk tea.  in the winters, i am a big fan of the seattle market spice; for summers, i usually pick a mild fruity tea (like black currant) for brewing ice tea.  i do question their storage method (left in transparent glass jars on open shelves) as i am pretty sure tea is supposed to be kept somewhere dark and dry to maintainde from a variety of teas, they also carry bulk spices, bulk coffee, tea cakes/biscuits, jams, chocolates, and soup mixes.  the shop owner will help grind your coffee upon request.  most of the candy and snacks sold here are quality items produced by small or foreign companies not commonly found in regular grocerypping for a gift?  you can find teapots and teacups (both classic european-style ceramic and some of the asian variety), as well as other tea-time accessories (including strainers, spoons, cloth napkins, etc.).  some of the teas are sold in old-fashioned, decorative tins--these make charming presents for a tea-lover you may the total

in the grocery stores - like beef hearts.  i went in today to buy a chicken and there were a couple pig heads sitting in trays, ready to go home - so, if you are an adventurous cook, this might be a good place to checkt they actually have varies from day to day but i can generally find something i would like to cook with, and they generally have a mixture of beef, pork, chicken, eggs, and slightly more processed stuff like meat sticks, ham, bacon, bacon ends, jerky and sausages.  some of these (like the smoked pork chops and the ham) are a little salty for my taste, but they are still pretty good and the prices are very reasonable.  i got some prime rib here for my girlfriend and i to have as a treat and it was excellent, extremely delicious and flavorful.  basically i am going to try and buy as much as possible of of my weekly meat here, instead of at the grocery store.","i am always shocked to find out there are people that have lived in champaign for years and still are not

sign up for their meatmail newsletter. this is my go to place for all things meat. on occasion, you can find some pretty interesting items in the meat case - pork heart, uterus, liver, etc. pretty gnarly. they sell a lot of items that most people would not consider purchasing or would just throw-away. this is a great stop for organ meats if you make your own dog food. it you are more into steak and chicken, they have that covered too. the prices are often better than the supermarket and you just ca not beat the quality. they do have some wonky hours that are sometimes difficult to shop around, but they do allow you to call in an order and pick it up so you do not have to waste time in line. if you have not been here, you must try it. it is hands-down the best meat deli in c-u.","as others have said, this place is one of the best kept secrets in c-u.  sometimes grocery markets in town may have specials that beat their prices, but you wo not get the quality that the meat salesroom has.  the students who work the counter know almost as much as any butcher, and far more than the person you would speak with at any grocery store.  to top that, they are eager to help, and able to deal with special requests.as far as i know, this is the only place in town to get picanha, my favorite beef cut.  it is not on their price list, but they usually stock a little bit of it, and it can of course be special prices do fluctuate, and they are not kept online, so it is wise to call before making a trip there.  they also tend to sell out a lot, so keep that phone number handy.  the

the red velvets are one of their classics, but the coconut and pistachio are spontaneous and amazing. ideally, you should always try anything seasonally-related. a great perk to the cupcakes is the serving sizes; they have a regular and a petite size of each flavor. this allows you to either try multiple flavors if you cannot decide but have a threshold for sugar, as well adjust according to your appetite. they have a wide selection of wines (red and white), bottled beer and coffee-type drinks to go with the cupcakes depending on what kind of evening you areated on a street filled with

about jarling is my freshman year i would have put on the freshman 50. but seriously. both times i have been i have gotten snowstorms (think blizzard + custard) and the junior size is more than enough. after having tried the chocolate chip cherry and blueberry cobbler mix-ins, i kind of want to make goal of trying ever flavor (kidding) - both were delish! there are windows and a line for each window, so that is something to keep in mind if you show up and it is super busy! service is a little slow but snowstorms are definitely made with love. you ca not rush a good thing! everyone i have talked to has been personable and friendly. outdoor seating is a little close to the road for my liking, but there is a pretty good view of campus and giant picnic tables to hang at while you shovel it in. and now i am craving custard, great.","best ice cream place in champaign. grasshopper with cold fudge= best damn thing i have ever had","first, the vanilla custard and cold fudge are great. unfortunately, the other custard flavors seem to be made with artificial colors and flavors. the key lime tastes like green skittles, and the strawberry has a strong resemblance to cheap, pink

is in st. louis -  have egg in them, giving them a heavier texture. my all-time favorite is a jarling custard cup chocolate almond crackle basket - that is vanilla custard in a waffle cup, topped with

champaign staple that all the locals go to and if you attend the university of illinois it certainly needs to be on your bucket list. the only thing you will regret about this place is not coming to

reasonable and what can be better than supporting a localy are not open in the winter so by the time march rolls around you are ready to have your first taste of the season. if you drive by and there

to laundry detergent, (bring your bottle to fill up!), to a variety of your usual supermarket products, bulk items and even some premade food items as well. hence why people were munching outside.

their plain tart is better than cocomero, and possibly better than pink berry too. i strongly suggest sampling it before getting it if you are concerned, but neither i nor anyone else i know has complained about the plain tart tasting bad or rancid. perhaps this was a one time anomaly?it does seem a tad short sighted of city girl yogurt to use girl in the title. i am all for girl only spaces but i am not sure they are in a position to do so, considering they are competing with cocomero which is already fairly well established in the champaign urbana area. i thought having to change the name would be a blessing, but unfortunately they did not want to make a big change and i think it is going to hold themt: my bad on the fruit comment. i know for sure the strawberries are fresh, but have not been in the shop for some time and may have made a mistake in my original post. i do stand by the girl in the title thing even though, as amanda y points out, it is not meant to encourage a

prices and freshness.  although, if you can suggest that people walk around the whole market before purchasing vegetables that pretty much makes it hard to argue that the market is \"large\".initially

the cheeses and baked products.  we have always been pleased with our purchases.if you go here with the intention to buy all your groceries for the week, you will probably be hungry by tuesday.

the picture.  there are lots of pretty flowers and some early season herbs and vegetables that will improve as the season progresses.  as farmer is markets go, this is nothing special, but it is local and, as the weeks pass, the selections of produce can reach impressive.  definitely walk around before buying as the prices may differ, as well as the quality.  my favorite part of the scene is when there is a tent for rescue dogs.  over time, there have been saint bernards, greyhounds, rottweilers, to name a few.  always such sweet beings with sad stories.  take one less basil plant and give that money to the rescue.  a sad part of the market is its proximity to the lincoln square mall, considered by some as the saddest mall in america.  but that is another review entirely.","a nice place

despite acres and acres of space, i found this park to be a pleasant destination for a sunday afternoon.  i have a mountain bike (it would be a stretch to say that i  amountain bike however) and i found the trails rewarding but challenging. these are trails for serious mountain bikers-tree roots that stick up about 6 inches from the ground, hairpin turns, narrow bridges, and people who do not understand the one-way signs for pedestrians and bikers respectively.  other than that, the bike trail weaves through a 16 acre lake that is absolutely stunning and is mostly covered by a green

more pleasant than at the other ymcas. it is also a little more difficult to get to from uptown than the childress klein ymca, which is a shame because i would much rather work out here. instead, it

huge hit for all dog lovers in the city. the dog run is huge--there is lots of room to let your dog run free and play with the 50 or so other dogs that might be there, too. there is even a smaller pen

its walking paths, abundant greenery and a little rippling creek.  but the peace is spoiled by the rush of traffic on the surrounding highways.  a constant roar in the distance. still, as long as you are not looking for contemplative silence, there is plenty with which you can stay busy.  they have courts for tennis and basketball, and picnic tables to fill up after a rousing game. there is

(phillies were on tv!!) sweet!! great selection of beers too:  fat tire, blue moon, sweet water, american domestics, guiness, etc.  all on draft.  only reason i did not give it 5 starts was because the cost.  i mean, it is in the epicentre and and in a really cool location but really pricey..best part of strike city:  the pizza comes from librettos next door (see review).  it is the best pizza in charlotte.  easily!.  enjoy!!-ian m.","attended a company event here and i must say this place is quite fabulous...we had our own private room with bowling lanes for those who wanted to bowl, plush

everyone will be talking about how much fun it was for weeks to come!","fun place with good food and great bowling. i was here for a private event so not sure about the cost but the pizza and sides were tasty, the bowling was fun, and i somehow managed to even bowl decently. i would come back here if i was back in town and in the area. the place is not huge so not sure i would come here for a bar if i was not planning to bowl.","chill vibe and pretty decor here. the place just looks like it would be a good time. if you are looking to bowl, just watch what night you go. you get charge by the hour, by the person so especially on the weekends, it can be incredibly pricey to bowl at strike. monday they host all you can bowl after Parent is watchingpm for $15 - awesome deal there if you are looking for a monday night venture. i think i have stopped in for drinks more than bowling, however. strike typically does drink specials ranging from mimosas to beers to shots. i typically stick to beer as liquor tends to run your tab up here. really, at strike, it is all about what night you go. on thursdays there is half off martinis and two 7/10 split tinis get me tipsy. the menu is ok, nothing to write home about. the pizza is delicious and i would recommend that for sure. the service has always been hit or miss here - do not get me wrong, it is been more positive than negative. heather is an amazing bartender, always smiling and does not let your glass go empty. others have not been as great but honestly, the service seems to be getting better the more i go and since it is always packed on the weekends it is easy to understand if you have to wait a bit for a refill. be on the lookout for one of their events. bi-monthly, strikecity olympics comes around - form a team of Short for for in Short Message Service and compete in games like pool, bowling, beer pong, flip cup, basketball and whatever else. just a fun night and winning team takes home a cash prize. it costs

yes please.  this is a great place to watch sporting events and hang with your friends and even meet other people.  the food is average bar food at best but suitable for this environment.  if you have a large party, their private bowling party room is a blast!!","great for large groups (reserve in advance, we had Short for for in Short Message Service0+). bartenders are friendly. good beer

went with my outfit that night...ok, at least that is what my wife said. you can play up to 8 bowlers per lane, which makes for a fun night out with a group and also helps disperse the cost of bowling. make sure to order pizza, as it comes from the pizzeria next door! the bar is big and it usually has a great crowd because of the amount of tv is! there is a ticker that runs around the place for up to date sports scores, and later in the night they play the music videos on some of the tv is that you hear throughout the place...long live def leopard! great beer specials too!","aside from

definitely shape how this place does in the next couple of months.  i am sure they will step up their game  (hopefully).  my last visit here was for a birthday celebration with a rather large crowd.  it ended up being fine, but for some reason our server disappeared toward the end, but we ended up going to the bar to settle up.  could have been she was overwhelmed with the group, but hopefully they are used to that since we only occupied two lanes.... more drinkers than actual bowlers.","as an alumnus of the ohio state university, and a huge buckeye fan, strike city has been a no-brainer for two years, as it is a huge buckeye hangout and they televise the games every saturday during footballt sunday, we arrived two hours early for the osu-michigan game, only to find the place packed.  the only available seats were random stools at the bar, and the tables that face the bowling lanes.  we have sat at the lane tables before for football games, and they have been fine, so we parked

really?!Parent is watching0% of their business comes from osu fans during the season.  not a single ball rolled down one of those lanes while we were there.  we found seats at the bar, and had a good

looking at you, marshall park! the pond, stone bridge and fountain in the middle are glorious. the landscaping and flower beds are usually well kept and benches are plentiful and in good condition. in the warmer months you have the added benefit of having great clouds of enticing smoke wafting over the park from the people cooking out at the various picnic areas. perhaps not a good thing for those repulsed by the smell of grilling meat, but whatever.if you go there to do some walking or jogging, i recommend doing some laps around the pond for a while before switching it up by going to the more shaded trail that goes along the other side of the creek. there are facilities for basketball, baseball, soccer, tennis and volleyball. since i do not really do sports, i ca not comment on how good the fields/courts are. my only real complaints would be that the water fountain at the southern end of the pond never works and the pond can get pretty nasty with pond scum and litter in some spots.","freedom park is very large and beautiful. this was my second time coming here. this visit i came for an event at a shelter. i liked how the bathrooms were inside. our shelter had a few

movie over a series of crisp nights, or maybe just head out on any old day to stroll around the lake.  if you are enterprising - and some of you are - maybe you will even get marriedugh the powers that be in charlotte want to insist that we are \"world class\", let is face it.  we are not.  probably never will be.  there is no central park, because there just is not room.  there is, however, freedom park.  it is a large park, with plenty of open space, lots of parking and all sorts of things to do outdoors.on the downside, it is not always well-maintained (like most other parks in the area).  while the grass and trees are typically handled well, the water is not quite as nice, so you will find dead animals and trash without looking too hard.  still, it is what it is, and it is one of the nicest parks in the area.","favorite park in the city! beautiful spot! fitness,family or fun!","by far the best park in or around downtown. something for everyone.","festivals are fun, tennis

skateboards, bikes, whatever.  then there is \"hippie hill\" a large rolling hill with different levels, perfect for bringing a blanket and just hanging out on a nice day, it also works perfectly as grass seats when there are performances at the bandstand, or when there are \"movies in the park\"  when companies come in and show movies projected on huge inflatable screens in the park.  this usually happens late spring and throughout the summer, and its free, a great place to take a date, or the family.if you cross the old suspension bridge you can get from freedom park, to the nature museum, and to the little sugar creek green way.  the little sugar creek greenway is a great walk, or bike ride, it runs all the way from woodlawn and park rd, through freedom park, and down to the intersection of kings and morehead, all following little sugar creek.  once you get past east blvd it gets kind of urban chic, because you actually go under east blvd, and then there are several cool short bridges, all concrete, that zig-zag over the creek.  it is  very chill to walk or ride bikes on this greenway, look at the ducks and watch the currents flow.  down towards the woodlawn part of the greenway you are more likely to see some more wildlife, like great blue herons, and kingfishers, and there are several interesting statues that have been carved into the trunks of felled trees that represent the fauna that inhabit  the greenway.if you follow the loop around the lake you will come to a place where the sidewalk goes across a small tributary of little sugar creek, once you cross this bridge you get to the main east blvd entrance to the park, which has a playground, with the \"old train\",  lots of volleyball courts, soccer fields, tennis courts, basketball courts, and baseball fields.  freedom park is a gem of a natural location located near the beautiful dilworth neighborhood, a great place to take the dogs for a walk, or to stroll with your significant other, and

have been to.  it is well landscaped and the lake makes a beautiful backdrop.  it provides a great opportunity for a romantic walk or a friendly conversation.  i love getting exercise in freedom park by walking, biking, or jogging around the lake.  it is very soothing.  during the summer and on the weekends, it can get quite crowded at the park, but if you can find a spot to park on those days, the park is still enjoyable.  i look forward to the day, though, that the bike paths are more connected with one another to provide a more thorough ride.  the festivals that are held at freedom park (festival in the park, for example) are fun, too.  i never buy anything artsy or craftsy, but i enjoy people watching, getting a bite to eat, and getting out to do something out of the ordinary other than my weekend target or mall run.","frisbee? check. picnic? check. scrabble? you damnedom holds a place in my heart. this is the second most frequented park for me in charlotte. i love the large space, the range of terrain from running and bike paths, to playgrounds, to island hopping, to outdoor theater, to sports fields, to wooded areas and meeting halls. en short, this place suits all of your park needs, and is a great place to people-watch.if so great, then why only Short for for in Short Message Service stars you may ask? two reasons.1.) clean up and maintenance: someone needs to seriously address the amount of bird poo in this area. i know i know, there is a lot of bird in the area that contribute to the picturesqueness of the park, and birds poo at an alarming rate. however, when it gets to the point where you need to look down when you are running (so you do not step in anything) instead of taking in the sites, or spend Meaning to in Short Message Service0 minutes looking for a place to spread your blanket that does not have a mound near in, something needs to be done. i know parks do not get a crazy amount of funding, but i would be willing to volunteer to clean up once in a while, and i hope other people would as well.Meaning to in Short Message Service.) this park has the best theater and seating that i have seen in a while... but i never notice any plays going on there? festivals and other events sure, but i have not seen any theater events scheduled or advertised anywhere. saw a guy doing yoga in it once, but it was a far cry from what i would been hoping to see. other than that... it shall remain a sunny day favorite.","fantastic park; clean, safe, lots to do (ample tennis courts, walking trails, play area for the kids), and there is usually nothing unusual or suspicious going on. definitely go in the fall. beautiful time of year.","freedom park...charlotte is answer to central park. okay, so maybe that is a tough comparison, but freedom park is a great place for running, walking your dog, picnicking, playing frisbee,re are numerous walking/running paths winding through the park, a lake in the middle to stroll along, and plenty of places to sit and take in the scenery and poeple grounds are nicely landscaped, and the colors in the spring and fall make it a great escape from the busy streets of charlotte.","coming from the triangle, i really wish we had a park as nice as this one. this park seems to have everything you could hope for in a park: a playground, a long trail along a creek, open courts and fields, lakes, ponds, and even a museum. the triangle has great nature trails for runners and bikers, but most of the parks are smaller and none of them have as many amenities as this one. the streets surrounding the park are also nice, with many cool shops and restaurants nearby. there are also bike lanes along the roads, and medians at reasonable intervals to make crossing the street easy. i am sure there are negatives to the park that i did not notice on my first trip, but i had a great time walking the park with susan z. i also highly recommend driving the streets around the park, which have beautiful old trees that create a lush canopy.","beautiful park!","a great park for walks, to relax and enjoy nature. dogs are welcome.","awesome park with something for everyone. it is large and the center lake/pond makes for great scenery with the wooded surrounding. whether you want to run, walk, play tennis or softball, enjoy the playground equipment or have a picnic, you be wo not be

 there are actually two different rooms for workouts.  there is one room that is the hot yoga room that is towards the right when you walk in to the left, there is a workout gym with weights.  what i like about the hot yoga room is that there are parking spots for your mat so everyone has a designated place and you do not have to worry if you are in the wrong spot or not.  the gym room (i do not really know what name they call it) is pretty cool as there is a matted section for different activities and then a corner for weights.  they have classes in there as well as it is superry since i came to my first class, i have enjoyed coming here.  i mean, i am getting such a good sweat and getting flexible and toning myself!

their surfing. there were many collisions and several rafts dumptrucked to the delight of spectators. when darkness arrived we simply moved our chairs about 50 feet to the other side of the island to view the fireworks show. this was the best view we have had of fireworks in years. the show lasted 15 minutes and occurred directly overhead. they do not lie when they say there is not a bad seat in the house. i was impressed by how well usnwc staff had prepared for and handled the crowds, parking and traffic. despite the location, it only took us about 15 minutes to get back to i-85 after the fireworks ended. there was a bottleneck on the trail back to the field where we pared, but that was kind of a fun adventure and they had thought to light the path. i imagined i was trekking through the jungle. praise: this remains one of the most outstanding venues for young families. lots space for kids to run around and dogs are welcome. criticism: they need to bring in some portajohns for the

especially if you go early in the season before the kiddos are out of school. we also opted for the meal plan so we have been scoping out all the dining establishments on site. papa luigi is is the best of the options for pizza and you can purchase overpriced alcohol here if you wish. jukebox diner has the best hamburger and a neat diner feel. harmony hall marketplace has great ac, terrible hamburgers, okay pizza and bbq but they do offer salad if you are looking for the healthy option. every meal combo is $10.Parent is watchingParent is watching without a drink so keep that in mind when planning your day. they will give you a cup of water at every food station for free if you request it. i would avoid going during peak times if possible because then the majority of the day will be spent standing and waiting. the rides do not have wait estimations either so it is anyone is guess as to how long you will have to wait. when we were there last saturday they were completely out of lockers too which meant we could not enjoy boomerang bang as much as we wanted. all said it is an okay place to go for locals but i would not drive out of my way to go. we live close so it works out for us.","carowinds is a fun place.....where else can you spend $Short for for in Short Message Service on a bottle of water?!","awesome rides!!!!!

i had no problem sleeping though, which was a relief.  second, the hotel is not in a great part of town.  there are some areas i would not feel comfortable walking at night by myself within just a

average 5-7 a year. true story. always the bridesmaid, never the bride. maybe i should be a wedding planner in my next family was super impressed with mel the planner that they worked with here. so much in fact, that the bride is father made it a point to rave about her in his speech. the cocktail hour was super nice and classy. i love the light fixtures in this hallway. so pretty. on to main room, the room was just gorgeous. very classy. the service was great. all the workers were professional, nice and pretty much on top of their game. the food was good. the transition from cocktail hour

great restaurant and bar options within walking distance.","clean rooms, flat screen tv is with hd, room service until midnight and 5 minute walk from the epic center. i love the fact that you have

just walked everywhere.","great room, appears to be completely renovated with minimal to no traces of the old.  friendly front desk and room service staff.  good location, there is a light rail stop

on a connection. clt is very large, and you will use about 10 moving sidewalks, and escalators. they do have nice rocking chairs spread throughout, however i doubt you will have time to lavish the

in a big huge line waiting to take off, or you will wait for an open gate for your plane to park. that gets annoying. in addition, the runways are really long, so it makes for a long taxi. i always joke and say when you are flying from clt you will feel like the plane is driving to the destination not flying.","here is the deal. american check c closest to my gate was 1st class only (no pre

did not know it it looks so well, i am really impressed with all the food choices and lounges to have a drink and how courteous the people are. i would like to see a little more transportation inside

construction. the construction appears to be under construction. hate you.","bojangles is awesome in this airport. great chicken sandos!","for some reason, i found this airport to be kind of depressing.  the fact that i arrived here after a red-eye from phoenix did not help make it any less depressing.  compared to other really nice airports i have been to (phoenix sky harbor, lax, detroit...), the rugs and chairs and pretty much everything at charlotte-douglas international seemed kind of old.  perhaps it was just the particular terminal i was in (us airways...never flying with them again, but that is another story), and maybe the rest of the airport is not quite so bad.  i have only been here once, so i would not still, it is an airport.  it is meant to be a place to board and disembark from planes.  and it suits that purpose just fine, but i prefer airports that are nice to wander around at during a layover  this one is not.","decent.  i had no clue this place was so spacious for a relatively small airport.  i loved the rocking chair seating options throughout the terminals.  the bathrooms were clean...though i was not sure how i felt about the old school bathroom attendee.  dates the place....and awkward in an airport setting.  it was easy enough to find my way around.  loved that they had a jamba juice, a variety of sit down restaurant options, and some shops.  i really did not like that you have to fight your way through the crowd of people just passing through security and the waves making their way between terminals.  that security section really needs to be pushed back a bit.  the absence of outlets at my gate was not all that grand, either....and i still do not know why we had to deplane on the tarmac, especially when we were on a plane large enough to have a proper first class section.  they also did not have enough staff to make it clear where to go to get inside of the airport.  we needed at least one person at the plane and another at the airportll, i am surprised that i really did not mind this airport.","charlotte douglas airport  is a credit to the place is clean , bright and people are friendly andl done

ever visited, but not the worst either.  i have only been to terminals d and e, and overall they seemed a little cramped.   the bathrooms were small and overall dirty.  the food options were hit or

and a nice and clean food court, plus a body shop and some other little boutique stores.  i have only transferred through here so cannot speak of the security and checkin services.","headed home. the airport is clean and easy to navigate - great access to rental cars and a decent collection of food options. the rocking chairs in the main terminal - they definitely rock.","being a pretty seasoned

really unprofessional in her handling of a traveler that happened to have missed her earlier calls to him.  heck, he still had over thirty minutes before boarding and his seat was given away.  for that, not feeling the love here.  reeks of jet fuel/exhaust in the e concourse too.  close the doors much?","had my first opportunity to visit nc the other week and flew into charlotte douglass international. the airport was not as big as i had imagined it would be, but that is ok. while i was not here long, i did find it easy to find my way around the airport, so signage was good. i noticed plenty of food and shopping places as i walked thru the airport, but did not have a chance to stop in to any of these places. on my way back home, i got thru the security line pretty quickly, so no complaints there. only downside for me was the rental car places are off-site, so you have to catch a bus. i much prefer airports where the rental places are on-site. but even at that, the bus came quickly and you are in a covered area while waiting, which is a good thing seeing as it was raining the day i came in. overall, no complaints, other than the us airways delay trying to get back to philly, but that is certainly not the airports fault...that is just typical us airways and phl!!","great airport and easy to make connections s. security isnty of food choices. clean bathrooms !!!american/ us air hub","bathroom attendant, rocking chairs, spacious and modern facilities, numerous shopping and eating establishments (not outstanding, but better than the run of the mill choices

bearable. you just need more airlines. but you are definitely a world-class airport.","always so busy coming through here.  people bumbling about and not enough space for them to do so.  the layout causes a lot of congestion and being  a hub for some major airlines,  this is an issue.  thank you for stepping up your restaurants and having such cute rocking chairs,  but this place is not one i am happy connecting through.","great airport, easy to get around. they have a lot of shops, restaurants and services if you have to hangout for your next flight. the only thing that is negative about this airport is the baggage claim area. you will wait forever! plus they do not let you know where to go to find your bags until the belt starts moving which creates a group gathering at the tv monitor.","ca not wait for construction to be over but this international airport is easy to travel through. gates are labeled well, staff is very helpful. the restaurants and pubs inside are very nice and off quite the variety of food types. they also offer many local beers in a few spots throughout the airport. security is pretty flawless and quick.","easy to get in and out of. employees are

biggest gripe. even for short term (at least for now), you ca not walk to the terminal, you have to take a shuttle. the ride to and from long term parking is hair raising - it is like being on an nyc

woo doggy!","had a layover here from az to jamaica. we arrived around 6am before/during shops were opening up. after walking around a bit we were able to locate a breakfast spot for a quick meal. after that we were off to jamaica.no problems here mon","charlotte-douglas is a fairly nice, yet huge, airport.  dining options are varied, and this airport has a lot to see and do duringking chairs are a huge plus :-d","great little airport. now direct connection to europe. live piano music in terminal. us airways hub. rental car shuttles run every few minutes. lots of charging stations for electronic devices. airport is also small enough to make transfers easy.","first things first, if it was not for jim (my gps which i have named as part of the family), i would never find this airport. mostly because i am not familiar with the area but also because airports tend to be hidden away even though their main purpose is, in fact, for people to find them and fly away from them. aside from that, i find this airport a little deceiving. i have been to some small airports (bangor, maine. moncton, new brunswick.) and i assumed, when walking into this one, that it was small like the previous ones mentioned. so i walk through security (more like shuffle considering the traffic and security procedures), which i might add, are thorough and friendly, and i come to this whole new dimension! the size of this airport is hidden until you cross security, then it is a playground (so to speak). i do like this airport a lot. i can shop (lets be serious, airport stores do have some great things), eat, lounge and board planes. the place has almost everything i need! the only thing i hate about the airport (and most airports) is that the wifi is not free. so pick up a magazine prior to arriving because you will need it to keep occupied. unless you are a people watcher, in which case, knock yourself out!","@ charlotte and ready for boarding!!","flew through here for the first time over the weekend. first impressions were good - nice layout, clean, fairly decent restaurants. it was easy to navigate from point a to point b. my second impression was not as good (when i came back through), but that was mostly because two flights were boarding side by side and so things were rather congested. nice airport though, i am sure i will be back.","free flowing crowd -- hospitable staff and a starbucks nearby -- winning!! i love that there multiple seating areas around for when you get exhausted from walking / flight","as a north carolina native now living in dc, i come through charlotte douglas pretty frequently.  i have never had a problem in this airport, but do not like the hub and spoke layout.  if you land in one terminal and have to get to another quickly, you better pick up the pace, as there is no train between terminals.  there is plenty of shopping, restaurants, and bars, but the layout makes it less than convenient to get to what you want.","at least the us airways terminal (which might be the whole airport, i am not sure) is awesome.  it is bright with real sunlight when possible with large windows and wonderful little rocking chairs to hang out on.  they have a chili is there right in the middle which is always a favorite with me, especially at the end of a long trip. who can say no to chips and salsa? and a beer?  i did not think so.it is super easy to get around the airport and while it is a spread out, it goes pretty quick.  i think they have free wi-fi too, and pretty good shopping if you left something at home.","for some reason i always have to connect between terminal e and terminal a. as a hub it is pretty busy so hoof it to your next gate!","free wifi, but little to no power outlets. ciao gourmet market (terminal d, gate dMeaning to in Short Message Service) has some of the best coffee (illy brand).","at the charlotte airport, en route to a connecting flight, i wondered which route might allow me to quickly satisfy a sudden caffeine itch.  so i walked up to a goodwill ambassador named dottie. i have always admired the airport goodwill ambassadors, or courtesy hosts.  i remember seeing the guys and gals in denver with the cowboy hats and western glow in their faces... and tags that read \"volunteers\".  volunteers!  gotta love folks like that.  they just stone-cold love their city that much, and want to share their enthusiasm.  sometimes i look at them, and their eager faces, as they scan for someone who might want to know why the rockies are wonderful or why colorado is a great place to send your kid to study minerology, and i see them identify a potential convert but then watch them walk by, and i think how sad it is when someone full of love wants to share it and is not granted the chance.  [i know, it is kind of a bit much that i read the sometimes-sadness of the human condition in the gazes of a stetson-bedecked airport welcoming committee.  but still.  you get me.]back to dottie...  i approached her.  she identified me as an in-bound inquiry on the verge of happening.  so she launched into phase one of her professional routine... she smiled at me.ok, wait, that previous sentence did not do the trick.  i wrote it wrong.  what i am trying to say is that she smiled at me.  high wattage.  mega dosage.  not too much, but also not nearly too little.  splendid.  brightness.  warmth.  like a force of nature.  but a force of nature that cared for you (like a breeze in the tropics), not a, it was one helluva smile.  you want to talk about feeling welcome someplace?  i did not just feel welcome in charlotte.  i felt welcome on planet earth.  people talk about aptitude for certain kinds of work.  whoever thought up the idea (perhaps it was her) to have dottie deploy her radiant smile as a greeter or goodwill ambassador was just simply very skilled at career suitabilitying encountered something so special, i felt funny asking something so mundane: where to get a cuppa joe.  but she rocked it.  and i walked i thought... christian, you ca not just walk away from a gift like that.  you gotta acknowledge it.  so i went back and i did.  and i learned something interesting...\"dottie, i am christian.\"\"nice to meet you.\"\"i just want to tell you that your smile is really something wonderful and i am glad i encountered it and its owner.\"if you can believe it, the smile intensified.  \"you have no idea how much i needed to hear that today.  thank you.\"and as i walked away, i marveled at what she would just said.  here she was, a professional and sincere dispenser of human warmth, who needed some herself.  i guess guardian angels sometimes need guarding, too.","as my home base airport i not only ca not dislike clt but i actually really do love it! like most airports i have been through, it is spacy and efficient. (i tend to blame travel hick-ups on the airlines and other inconsiderate travelers more than the airports.) due to some recent renovations clt has had a bit of a face lift on the arrivals floor. for starters they got rid of the carpet and replaced it with the more logical tile main atrium is beautiful and contains quite a few different food and shopping options - even if i do always follow my nose to cinnabon. the wall of windows lets light in and the trees are a pleasant addition that i do not recall having seen in any other airports to date. lastly, why is everybody hating on the white rocking chairs? it is quite obvious these things are charlotte is touch of southern charm. i, for one, have never even had the chance to sit in one because they appear to be so loved by all the other travelers. there are of course the power outlets there too.as far as getting to the airport and checking in, it runs smoothly. the traffic flow is great and surprisingly compared to other roads in downtown charlotte the pavement is not nearly as riddled here. there are lots of parking options from hourly to long term including business valet. for check in there are at least three security checkpoints to go through and if all are open the \"speed of service\" is commendable.","clean, nice looking and lots of different places to eat. i have had Meaning to in Short Message Service short lay overs here and each time i have had to walk through the airport to get to a connecting flight so i was able to see a good portion of it. the large windows really brighten up the terminals which makes me think more places (phoenix sky harbor mainly) should follow suit.","basically the totally opposite of newark libertyan and well-lit. friendly and courteous tsa members, and fast and efficient layout and service.","free wifi but not much range. decent food selection. go with salsarita breakfast burritos! wish there was a local alternative to starbucks. it really isnt good coffee people. if you see an older pilot, do not try to be nice to them. they are disgruntled. you would be too if your company took over a million dollars of your pension away while upper management all took bonuses.","had a layover here recently coming in from an international destination. customs was not too bad, basically waved us through. but we had to exit to the main terminal and re-go thru security, which is freaking insane! we had an 80 minute lay over and i think we only got to the plane with Meaning to in Short Message Service0 minutes to spare - they were already boarding. ugh!","a decent enough airport. there is lots of construction going on in and around the airport which can make for some interesting moments. however, overall, charlotte douglas is a clean and easy to navigate airport. the hitch for us was in baggage claim. it was ridiculously slow. one of the ladies who was on our flight said that they have a reputation for slow baggage handling. i got my bags back in the same condition as i left them so it worked out okay. the construction gave us an impromptu tour of the airport while we tried to return our rental car. we did not come in the main entrance and there were signs for rental car return all along the road until we came to a fork in the road and there was no guidance on which way to go. we chose poorly and ended up driving around the place. coming in through the main entrance, we had no issues. everything was clearly marked, so be warned that if google maps sends you the back way, you will need to be careful.","coming from chicago and \"enjoying\" (ha) ohare and midway for years, i really enjoy flying in and out out of charlotte (clt). while many of my flights still take me back to chicago, i ca not help but enjoy the simplicity of clt. security line? what security line i say. those of you who travel a lot know what i mean. frequently you can walk right up the the security person and show the pass and id. sometimes there is a line, but it moves quickly. rarely do i show up earlier than one hour to the airport. i am a check in online, go and park, security line to boarding person. no waiting around and airport for me. clt allows me to do this while other airports do not. parking is cheap too...$6/day.","haha when i was here tryin to fly back to lax and also back to nj another time my flight was delayed ...it was pourin out...it sure does rain a lot in nc!","bathrooms smell bad but there is free wifi.  food options are ok, i got a bagel w/ egg & cheese for $5.looks like an older airport.  lots of old, white, southern people.  the free wifi made me happy, will not mind flying through again.","clt is a cool airport. lots of eats..free internet...i find it easy in and out.. but it is busy. who would have thought in nc that an airport would be so busy. clt has a very strict lightening procedures... they have several ground stops in the summer.. bring your laptop and good reading..","i am bumping charlotte-douglas up to a three...it is almost to a Short for for in Short Message Service-star level, but i will refresh this review once they have finished all the renovation ander two years, they finally finished and opened the new hourly parking garage, which allows you to park right near the terminal if you are picking up or dropping off someone. yeah, a novel concept, right? well, it may seem that way for charlotteans, considering they have not had a parking lot within walking distance to the terminal in those twoe not connected through clt in a while, but i ca not imagine too much has changed. it was always adequate for connecting and layovers, but nothing to write homey are working to modernize this airport...it is showing signs of being in the Meaning to in Short Message Service1st century...hopefully they will wrap up construction soon and it can function as such.","did you know that the white rocking chairs at charlotte international were originally part of an art exhibition? the rockers became a permanent airport feature because passengers loved them so much. and if you want to purchase your very own rocking chair, just ask one of the airport officials and they will let you know the local business that made them. charlotte international is one of my favorite airports. it is very easy to get in and out of here and the design is very efficient for travelers to get from place to place . but the one thing that always brings a smile on my face is the free wi-fi. i love airports that have free internet. they also have a great restaurant selection in the food court and in the terminals. they have bojangles, carolina barbecue and more. no rail system around the airport though","charlotte has always been a great airport. very clean and recently updated. for layovers there are tons of food and shopping options. the tsa is super quick too for security. however, you are usually on a 10-15 minute minimum delay when departing- probably due to the high volume of flights??? anyways, beware if you have a short layover elsewhere.","an international hub airport with that regional airport feel.  take from that what you will.","as airports go this one is among my favorites.  lots of shops, eateries, and an attempt or two to sell local craft beers in \"carolina beer co,\" (terminal d) and \"a taste of carolina\" in terminal b.  but see my carolina beer review.  avoid ...seriously ...that crappy tequila taqueria place that is about the most boring mex food i have ever had.  taco bell destroys it...nuff yes...the rocking chairs and free wifi are charming","connection in 10 min...keys here i come!","clt is my favorite major airport in the us. am i biased because i work for the city of charlotte and the city owns/runs clt??? -perhaps... but, even when i lived in savannah (many moons before coming to charlotte) i would purposefully schedule us airways flights so that i could be routed throgh clt rather than atl. maybe it is the rocking chairs in the main food court, maybe it is the amazing art glass in the international terminal, or maybe it is the fact that it is a super clean major airport that was well planned and easy to navigate -clt provides travelers with an excellent first impression of the queen city.","comfy chairs, free wifi, decent terminal layout, bagels for breakfast and bbq for every other time, this is a great place to stop if you have got a bit of time between flights.","came to this airport to connect to another flight. had a 1Meaning to in Short Message Service hour layover which is fine because i was made aware of this upon booking the flight. went downstairs to baggage claim because the airline overhead compartments were full (again no big deal). picked up luggage only to be told cannot go back upstairs where restaurants since we left out the main area of the airport!? i informed the agent that we have not eaten and only came downstairs because that is we were advised to do. she informed us that there was a starbucks and that we could eat there (totally not what i was looking forward to). but i can deal with that..although i was very upset at the moment. what i cannot deal with are mice running past my feet upon working on my computer and eating my sandwich!! this is totally unacceptable for an airport and i advise everyone that comes to this airport to watch your bags..and do not put them on the floor!! this is the last time i will be flying into charlotte airport if i can help it..and if i have to come here i will just rent a car and drive...smhdissatisfied customer ...","hub of us airways, not a very large airport.my first time to take us airways and transfered to cak at here. as the merging process of aa and us slowly going on, us airways will vanished in our eyes within 1-Meaning to in Short Message Service years. the end of an era.","all-in-all this is a very nice airport.  some reviews say it is small, but i think that is only because they only saw their concourse.  as a charlotte resident, this is my airport for domestic and international flights.  i think i have been to every terminal and can tell you that it is a quite large airport.  there are some pretty decent restaurants and shops if you need to kill some time between flights. my only critique would be the process for international arrivals. american citizens no longer have to fill out the customs declaration form, but do have to queue up for a bank of machines that take your picture and scan your passport.  the machine then spits out a ticket you give to the customs agent.  it is a bit of a melee, but does not take all that long.","a bit congested and the golf carts shuttling peeps around were constantly getting stopped with all the congestion.  outdated decor.  not enough seats by the gate area.  lots of selection to grab a bite.","bible belt yall.  first things first... the airport is just fine.  it is clean, pretty big and offers a wide variety of options for food.  the airport does get pretty busy, so arrive accordingly.  also, their liquor laws are suuuuuuper strict (read no booze on sunday until at least noon).  just sayin.","a nice airport with lots of great dining options. this airport is pretty modern and has a lot of daily traffic. my only complaint is that it is spread out horizontally and it always seems like my connection is at the other side of the airport. be sure to give yourself plenty of time to connect because if you get delayed it may be hard to reach your connecting gate in time.","because charlotte, nc is a growing city, everything is new, glossy, and ready for business from those who are just taking up roots in the city. as a result, clt is receiving the same \"tear it down and start again\" treatment.  this airport is special enough to have a pinkberry considering not many of the airports house their own pinkberry.  of course they have a chili is, a mexican restaurant, and a shiny food court.  the place is not as large as dulles international but from all of the construction, i would say it is well on its way.  to sweeten the pot even more, the people who work here are very helpful, patient, and professional.  you will not get attitude from the employees like you would at jfk.","easy to navigate. the best thing each time i connect in charlotte is the piano player between concourse b and a. so nice to see live peaceful music in the hussle and bussle of the airport.","decent selection and clearance pricing can be found at the brooks brothers store.  once you are done shopping and still have some time to kill before catching your flight, you can rest your bottom on one of the dozens of white rocking chairs that line the atrium.  the rocking chairs are a nice perk and you should definitely try to take advantage of them if you only complaint i have are with the transport carts.  they are constantly beeping no matter what direction they are going.  i can understand the beeping while in reverse, but it is really annoying when it is constant.  especially when you have Short for for in Short Message Service0 minutes to kill at thenk goodness for the free wifi...","clt  depends on your carrier but there is some nice food options. it is been upgraded recently, funny the best food is on the domestic piers and the international piers have the least to offer. the first flight sushi is great, us has two lounges b and c","+ relax on the rocking chairs+ countless dining options+ shopping and massage places to pass the time+ plenty of seating at all the gates+ free wifi!","clt used to be better, but their passenger volume has increased significantly. i used to fly out of here as my main airport from Meaning to in Short Message Service005-Meaning to in Short Message Service010, but have since moved away and just returned back. it is moderately-sized and laid out well, with well-placed maps throughout the terminal. there is also a decent selection of downside that i found on my recent trip is that volume is up heavily and there is not enough room to accommodate the additional passengers. the hallways were packed and there were no empty seats to ben the u.s. airways lounge was crowded.","clt is very easy to navigate through and with pre-check at this airport getting to your gate ise the large food court as soon as you go through the checkpoint.","been here several times. fairly convenient parking, good places to eat. just a nice airport as airports go.","easy to navigate. clean. and lots of food choices. also has a nice bright waiting area central hub.","decent airport.  had alot of things to eat but was also rather big and crowded for a city as small as charlotte.","blech. this airport is kinda dirty and smells sour. it is also overly crowded since it is a layover hub, if you are in a rush to get to a  connecting flight you will no doubt be stressed out. one good thing, it is not as bad as a certain chicago airport i wo not mention by name.","clean. easy to navigate. as a first time visitor to this airport but a frequent flyer in many others charlotte douglas gets Short for for in Short Message Service stars.","always liked this airport. not to big but not to small either. plenty of food options. nice modern art. they do a good job at keeping it clean. my two favorite spots are the uso long and the rocking chairs. the uso is top notch. you can tell they put a lot of work into it.","great airport, and that is coming from someone who usually hates flying u.s. airways (which clt is a hub for).  they fly direct to san diego, which has been useful for me going back to my college days flying out of roanoke, va.  the u.s. airways terminal has a bojangles next to the gate flying to san diego, which is a welcome treat everytime i see it.  there is no better way to say bye to north carolina than with a cajun filet biscuit.  they could use more power outlets, but they also get credit for the awesome rocking chairs around the terminal.","from what i saw at 6 a.m., it was nice. the flight attendant who was riding standby said the food is good and the best prices around.","clt was once quaint and welcoming. it is no longer. the \"courtesy\" cart drivers act like they transferred from phl. there is often an out of service moving sidewalk. the urinals are always dirty because there is not enough water to flush. i am considering switching airlines so i no longer have to connect through clt. it is a dump.","after a few visits here, i gotta say, it is not the biggest airport, but it sure is comfortable.","i always seem to get placed on the complete opposite end of the airport, when making connections, and have less than Short for for in Short Message Service0 minutes to get where i need to go.  as usual, the moving walkways are not working either.  places to charge you device?  nope.  you would think with the volume of flights clt has, they would be better prepared, but i guess not.","bottom line at the top: tsa is definitely nicer here but they need to work on dining options. until that happens, your best would be chilis.--i fly through this airport a handful of times per year and not much ever really changes. everyone is very friendly, the chilis is always popping no matter what time of day, and bojangles always has the longest line.i saw that a genghis grill is opening soon but that is not enough! im glad i have loving family members to send me on my way with yummy sammies and snack age, i hope you do too!","clean, modern, with plenty of (boring) food options.  i would have loved a big southern breakfast, but chains abound.  comfy chairs.","decent airport, but it is always a mass of humanity.  be sure to stay in your seat if you get one, because you will lose it.","easy to get in and out.  all the shops were closed when my flight arrived at 10:Meaning to in Short Message Service0 pm but so not much to say about that.","easy to navigate. plenty of food options. careful about the distance between terminals though..","every time i come here, there is a little more construction done. it is a breeze to pull in and drop off. parking to come in with someone flying out is a different story. no places even remotely close to park. the new entrance to airport from 85 is little rock can still go billy graham parkway but this isngs you past car park lots and cell phone lot right to terminal. the terminals themselves are very nice, plenty of restaurants and gates are not miles away from check-in area.","\"rocking chairs and free wireless.\"  borrowing from david s. b. [hey it is a great opening.]  those two things do set this airport apart from others.  the rocking chairs make me think of my grandparent is house at the lake.  they also create an appearance of things are slower here, you do not need to rush to your gate, just take a seat and relax.  welcome to southern hospitality.   and about the free wi-fi ---- it is not the southern way to gouge our guests, we want you to feel at home.","although i only been here three times i can say that this airport is always busy. the bathrooms are clean and they have a lot of restaurants and shops to choose from","all three stars go to the ladies in charge of the bathrooms.  charlotte has the best bathrooms - its official. super clean, mints, perfume and a lovely welcome \"hello welcome, welcome - all the rooms are clean.\"both food options i tried were awful - there was a sushi bar but it was Parent is watching deep so no chance of a seat there.  lots of rocking chairs for some reason but the biz folk looked very comfy in them with their puters and kindles.","five years later, it is time to update my clt review. between Short for for in Short Message Service/Short for for in Short Message Service/Meaning to in Short Message Service00Parent is watching and today, i have departed from or arrived at this airport over 100 times. i have also gotten a couple of gate passes to escort my daughter through is still a good airport for layovers. lots of restaurant options from a fancy wine bar to a sit down burger joint, plus a full spectrum of fast food. the main atrium even has a pretty good barbecue spot if you are looking for carolina cue and ca not leave the secure those departing from clt, you can use *any* of the security checkpoints. unlike some airports (newark), once you are inside charlotte you can go to any gate. the line at a is usually pretty long, so feel free to wander up to b or c if they lookthwest, united and delta are in the a concourse. american is also there but might be moving as a result of the merger. jetblue and lufthansa are in d, is:- rental car franchises are not located in the terminal - you do have to catch your company is shuttle bus.- there is not a smoking lounge inside the secure area. you have to go outside and follow the signs.- b and e checkpoints have tsa precheck lines. other checkpoints have \"elite\" security queues which are not specific to just us airways. any elite passenger is allowed to use it!- there are two us airways clubs. with us moving to the oneworld alliance, american airlines folks who have admiral is club access can use thesesider trying park n go instead of business valet. i find their service is better and cheaper than the airport is service.","free wifi. otherwise, standard overcrowded airport (it is a hub).","charlotte-douglas is a very small airport and it pretty easy to navigate as a result. security is pretty smooth and i usually only have to arrive 1 hour to Short for for in Short Message Service5 minutes before my flight to get to the gate on time. i always check in electronically, however i do not believe they are equip with the smartphone scanners for paperless travel. not to big of a deal, the electronic kiosks and usually never too busy so printing a boarding pass is quick and easy. the long term parking lots a pretty cheap if you ca not arrange a ride and located very close to the airport so the shuttle ride is short. give yourself 15 extra minutes if you need to park long term.","busy and confusing. it is a nice and large open space filled with many escalators and walking escalators. the people are friendly and do try their best to help. every terminal/section has a special desk where people who have missed their flights can go to rebook and/or get on standby flights. unfortunately, the customer service desks cannot handle situations where there is a large number of people who need help. the lines can get absolutely ridiculous!! overall, a relatively comfortable area (for an airport) with plenty of food options.","i always seem to arrive here after an international flight and am forced into a long line at customs to use the passport scan machine for a ticket which then places me into another line to go through customs with an officer who then says exit making you believe you are done but no! wait  to see another officer to hand over the ticket you printed out from passport machine that checked you in.  ridiculous. even so, the lines are always super long and i saw non us citizens get through quicker without having to use machine scan for passport. what? after going through all of that i was forced back through tsa to have my luggage scanned again and then off to find my gate. a Short for for in Short Message Service5 minute layover will not allow you enough time if you are connecting from an international flight. be warned!  while i love the airports beautiful up keep and variety of businesses,  i hate the gate layout. good luck getting to another gate if you see something you need and back in time for your flight. instead, suck it up and select by if you must or avoid all together. oh and the free wifi is horrible!

the moving walkway is always fun and you put less effort when rushing for a connecting flight just make sure you do not bump anyone..the concourses are not confusing like other airports and the main intersection has a food court feel which is nice. white rocking chairs sporadically placed around the airport has a nice touch to it. good place to have a layover.","disclaimer: i have only passed through this airport for connection flights and i have never had much of a lay over. it is not as big as many of the other hubs like detroit, atlanta and minneapolis. but it is still big enough to need a tram of some sort. i have not spotted a tram if there is one here. the moving sidewalks just do not cut it when your connecting flight is already boarding. many of the moving sidewalks (and there are a lot of them) were not working, as in out of service. even an escalator was out of service. if you have ever wondered what it is like to tote a carry on luggage up stairs, i will inform you that it is not very fun. the bathroom had an attendant but the bathroom was not as clean as many of the other airport bathrooms that i have used. there were not any toilet seat covers. some airports even have the rotating plastic seat covers, so nothing at all is very \"behind in the time\". there was a food court and an area that had rocking chairs. that was a first time that i have noticed rocking chairs in an airport. i did not use them, it was just another observation, plus i was trying to note something positive about this airport.","a small airport that needs some improvement. this place seems to be in the middle of a big rebuilding effort. most of the terminal is done, but the parking garages and car rental areas are still under construction. the lines for security here are long. bored tsa agents mindlessly repeat the same instructions over and over. \"shoes off! laptops out!\" there are not many places to eat here. i love it when local restaurants are featured in the airport. not here. wendy is is one of the slim choices for food. long moving sidewalks take you past movie posters of feature films that were shot in the charlotte area. there were a lot of car racing films shot here, and evil dead ii! there are not too many things to see or do here. no big public works of art. no interesting shops. just newsstands and fast food. the traffic here is maddening. at the arrivals area, traffic is slowed to a slow snarl, and it takes for ever to get out of there. i am not a big fan of this airport.","clean and friendly.  have no complaints except that you tend to always sit on the runway awhile.","clean, some renovations under way.","as far as airports go, this one is my favorite by far. they did a good job showing southern hospitality by airport standards if you are lucky enough to be stuck with a layover here. the atrium with the open air, sunlight, and rocking chairs definitely allow you some personal recharge time before you get back on another airport is mid-sized, not gigantic like dallas, so you should not feel extremely rushed to make it to the other side of the airport.","hate hate hate flying... but being from portland, or where my family is from i fly here and there a couple times a year. charlotte... could suck less but there are some things they are doing ok. it is not really that hard to find  your way around but one of my big pet peaves is lots of displays and things like carts getting in the way of rushing to a terminal. some of the walkways seem narrow  but that could be just me. hate security here. i had one flight where i got delayed over night (at the airport for about 16hours) and the only thing i got was a t-shirt and some tooth hygiene things. luckily a sweet lady who was one of those star partners(?) got me a alternative flight that got me home faster than the delayed plane wouldides all that at least clt is not atlanta or newark!","as someone who went to college far away from home, i spent a fair amount of time on airplanes and in airports, and the difference between a great port and a lame port is really important.  the charlotte airport has a variaty of fast-food and sit-down restaurants that offer a large range of food options (go to the chili is if you want to drink and smoke before you flight).  the airport also has large bookstores that offer all the knick-knacks, snacks, or magazines you could want for a plane, plus an assortment of other retail stores.  the wait here is usually painless and the staff is veryt_  ok people i mean if your flight is delayed and you are stuck in a airport f course you will be pissed.  but i mean that happens about half the time you fly anywhere.  if you are seriously saying this ariport deserves one or two stars you obviously have not had the lovely opportunity of visiting the raleigh, nashville, moblie, birmingham, or new orleans airport just to name a few off-hand...","actually this is one of my favorite airports. i like the fact that there are rocking chairs in all the terminals for use by weary passengers. the food selection in the main area is not bad as well as some of the offerings in the different terminals. flights are usually pretty much on time unless there is a major thunderstorm passing through the area.i chose to travel on an airline other than usair, which \"owns\" this place, and everything went quite well. the airport is very clean and everyone is courteous. not a bad place to spend time between flights.","honestly wish i could give it zero stars based on today... I have a question security is beyond the worst. check in with the airline was smooth, thats about it.i am sure its not this bad everyday, or it would be on the news and or shutdown from the lack of business....","always a good airport when you have free wifi. nice place. well designed. medium size airport.","as airports go, this is one of the better ones. a large open atrium in the center joins all of the gates which gives you the feeling of being outside.  rocking chairs and free wifi, both good qualities. no shuttles or trains between gates or baggage claim. they are doing a huge construction project right now on the hourly parking areas, so a lot extra time for parking."]},"Knights Inn Charlotte":{"name":"Knights Inn

variety of options to choose from.  wine or champagne plus a sweet treat were offered each afternoon during check-in. the lobby and common areas offer nice seating, bar and restaurant as well as seating and fire pits in the outside hallways and rooms are nicely finished. the rooms themselves are decent sized - not large but not small. the bathroom is a little cramped. it is fine for one person or two. there is parking in front - but not a lot of it. once they fill up it is a bit of a hike around the hotel to get to your car. they do have valet parking (which is part of the reason the space is limited). but self-park is free so that is fair enough. the rooms do have a fridge. the only down side is you have to pay for the internet if you are not a marriott rewards things make this one of the best hotels in the area. one it has a great bar and bartender, they have food until pretty late into the evening as most places in the area stop cooking by ten. second is the hotel in general has great facilities as their gym is a step or two above the normal gym as first time i have seen a hotel pool with a device to assist people into it. they also have a nice courtyard for large

like a place that your grandma might have hung out at in her old pictures. the place looks like a traditional southern plantation or estate. the artwork, the china, the tapestries, the little doilies all would make your grandma squeal with delight. we arrived to find that they had put my mother and me in the wrong room with one small bed. i frowned at the staff, and pointed out that there must be some sort of mistake. they apologized   greatly, and showed us to our correct room, which was in the attic of the main building. our room was one of the strangest b&b rooms i have ever stayed in. it was named after an old-timey western actor, and had books about him, and photos of the guy all over the room. since we were staying in the attic, the roof was sloped inwards, and we kept banging our heads on the roof. the decor was quite interesting, with weird trinkets and decorations. they had a rocking horse creepily placed in the corner, watching over the room. the room was quiet and pleasant. the mattresses seemed like they were made at the same time as the house was, they were quite old and broken in. we had access to the air conditioning controls, since someone had previously broken the lock on the control panel, so our room was quite comfortable once we set the temperature. the food here was average. they served us breakfast. eggs, bacon, coffee and toast. the staff was very nice and pleasant. they did not know too much about the area, but they always smiled as we walked in, and took good care of us. the grounds here are absolutely beautiful! if you get a chance, i

sort of competition. but the prices are reasonable for the areas they ares particular location is adjacent to the airport, so for those flying to/from, such as myself, it is incredibly convenient. it is also located along a major interstate and was very simple toking through the hallways, you might think you were headed for an underwater adventure. i wish they would spend that money on the hallways inside the rooms with better shower features or thicker padded chairs. but...alas...the room passed muster and the bathroom could have benefit from an exhaust fan, though most hotels simply do not offer those. the shower needed recaulking around the shower head so that it did not pop away from the wall. i notice this in so many hotels, and it is something that cleaning staff can easily notice, so it tells me that hotel processes do not include reporting those sorts of fixes regularly (daily) or maintenance does not prioritize those fixes or the hotel does not care. for this lower tier hotel, they are probably fine withakfast got the job done, enough, i suppose, until i found something else to eat at the airport. the breakfast bar was a mess, and the employee staffing it apologized as she was trying to frantically clean and restock it after a group of children competing in something went ballistic on the cereal, waffle maker, ands may not be the four seasons, but it

planes constantly buzz the roof of this building, and you hear jet engines roaring by every minute until very late at night. the windows rattle each time a flight screams by on its way to land. the internet here is slow. do not even try to netflix it here, cause it ai not happening. at least they offer a television with a large selection of channels. they offer complimentary copies of usa today and the wsj, which is much appreciated! they even have a kiosk where you can check in on your flight, and print out boarding passes. it is a large touchscreen television with a printer, which is supposed to be convenient. i was trying to print out my boarding passes with this helpful display, and the whole thing came crashing down from the wall almost crushing me. the computer monitor fell with a loud crash and immediately glitched out. nobody was around to notice, or help. i tried my best to hang it back on the wall, and managed to get it up at a crooked angle, but without a boarding pass. sorry, marriott. i was happy that the a/c worked properly, and there was plenty of parking. they do have an on-site restaurant, and a starbucks."]},"Four Points by Sheraton

pretty far from problems started at check-in when my room was not ready.  this would be nitpicking if i had tried to check-in sometime in the early afternoon.  it is pretty inexcusable given that it

restoring both even though other parts of the property were unaffected.  i was able to connect to the wifi but not the internet so i was pretty sure what needed to happen to restore service.  i called down to ask the girl at the front desk to reboot the modem and caught a bit of attitude and a \"someone is working on it.\"  a couple of hours later, i called again and got a different answer from the same girl.  this time, the story was \"the electrician refuses to touch it.\"  the storm rolled through around dinner time and i went to bed at about 11 without having a/c or internet restored.  i found a handful of free breakfast coupons under my door in these two problems with the hotel each resulted in a freebie (which i appreciate) but there seems to be an endemic issue with how the place

hate the power it has over people ---to lose all ability to walk, speak and behave normally. when i go to ikea, i am on a mission. so that means if you are standing still in the middle of the maze that ikea is, i will take you out. i do not want to lallygag around looking at every item-as much as i love ikea-i want to get in and out of there! i am a fan of their rugs, kitchen and bedroom accessories but havent had much luck with their furniture since you have to assemble it and bob vila, i am not. after a fail of a home improvement project concerning a bed frame i bought at ikea (which is now being held together by duct tape since i ca not figure out how to fix it since i did not keep the ikea tools to put the bed together), i definitely wo not be buying furniture from ikea ever again. if you go online and create a shopping list and select your local ikea, it will tell you what bin or part of the store the item is in so you do not have to write everything down as you look. my most successful, less busy trips have been sunday late-afternoons or weeknights. if you go on saturday between 10a-5p, you are just asking for a death wish.","hmm....what is a great way to

amazingly cheap food and entertainment. my wife and i venture in on multiple occasions (most of which are rainy days, so this is our rainy day spot) with a goal of only spending around $Meaning to in Short Message Service0-$50. what is great about ikea is that $Meaning to in Short Message Service0 actually stretches really far. we have walked out with five picture frames, beer mugs and few

playland on the first floor. seems like kids are deliriously happy while their parents are shopping. drop off the little ones while you search for that perfect desk/sofa/kitchen/bed!my only gripe with this location is the lines. there are about Meaning to in Short Message Service5 different lanes and probably over 50 registers. on busy days, only about half are open and the lines tend to back up. we have waited for over half an hour just to check out! i mean....being that close to the cinnamon rolls and you are just out of reach because of the immense lines...i think having a few more staff

pressed to find an establishment with as many happy employees. everyone i spoke to was extremely nice and very helpful. they genuinely enjoy being at work. the prices on non perishable items ca not be

best in trying to keep everything moving, but where they fail is that they need to open more checkoutrall, i would rather go to the other costco in matthews if i had the choice...but the drive is a

great place to take people from bigger, more antique/vintage crazy cities - there is a ton of awesome vintage here, and while you are pawing through the 60s70s80s frocks, gramma can be fingering

ever been there that i have not purchased more than i intended. they have vintage lp albums; herend porcelains; vintage clothing to anything else large and small.as with any vendor based retail models. the pricing is controlled by the individual inventory owner vendors. you will find pricing from a to z but i think that they are fairly reasonable. some vendors need to be aware of what their neighboring booths sale and prices that they sale so do not \"snag\" the first item you are looking for because you will find others that have the samey only problem that i see which is a great problem to have, is the parking is very limited and is compounded by the large food vendors trucks and booths that take up a fair amount of real estate in the parking lot. it is a bit confusing that

much else. sleepy poet may have bit off more than it could chew in classifying itself as an antique mall. first appearances lead me to believe that it is more of an artist commune and clothing store. i was overwhelmed with and slightly disappointed in the volume of finished artsy pieces.  i have been to a number of antique malls that have successfully incorporated both handmade art and antiques - but the poet seems to lean too heavily on the handmade art. with that being said, they do have a large quantity of vintage clothing pieces, but that and their free popcorn will not get me through the door staff are nice and i did find one small item to purchase (vintage military duffle bag), but price-wise i could have done much better online for the condition. also use caution if you are needing to use a store supplied shopping cart to carry your potential purchases. with narrow aisles and a number of booths filled with large items that that stick out, i found myself bumping into things that could have been potentially costly to me. my hubby and i abandoned our cart mid-way through our visit for fear of knocking something or someoneces for a few other items that caught my eye were in the upper moderate to high range which made me think twice about buying anything else. usually, when i see a piece i have to have and know it is a good value - i get it. not in this case since i found myself checking the price before falling in love with anything. i also found that there appears to be a few vendors that have similar booths set-up here as well as other local antique malls i have visited - however the prices appeared higher at the poet. not sure if they felt the need to raise their prices due to the location. handmade art pieces and vintage clothing, yes ...reasonably priced antiques, not so much.","always a good selection of unique decor and furniture pieces at the sleepy poet. plan to come with some time to browse as it is a large, air conditioned facility with plenty to look at. the place has individual vendors that stock all kinds of merchandise pieces from large furniture, to light fixtures, retro clothing, wall art and all kinds of books and trinkets. the mall is laid out in a relative grid pattern though it still is easy to get lost your first couple of visits. if you want to negotiate on a larger item, the staff will be happy to call the booth representative. if they ca not get them on the phone they will take your number and contact you back. overall a large and unique mall full of all kinds if great finds to decorate.","a fun place to spend an hour, very eclectic selection but you can find some cool stuff if you are open.","fun.","for antique shoppers.....this is a must stop shop!this is a very nice layout, with many individual

coffee and chocolate samples. there was a great selection of produce and other products that i cannot find in general grocery stores. i will definitely be back.","am a big fan of trader joe is and only wish there was one closer to huntersville.  we generally hit this location although i sometimes head to the uptown one before leaving work for home. i really enjoy many of their pre-packaged meals.  the mandarin orange chicken is good, much cheaper and just as good as what you would get at many chinese restaurants.  other favorites are the french onion soup and carmelized onion dip.  with the dip, i recommend buying two because one will not last you long enough!  we ran out friday night and i am feeling compelled to make the drive again today.  we also buy a bunch of the frozen fish items to have in the freezer for a quick blackened mahi or seared tuna steak dinner.  while obviously not fresh, have found the taste to be pretty good oncen one in huntersville and you get 6 stars

some chevre and crackers! i gotta say i was really not used to the layout of the store here maybe because they had to cram so many things into a rather small space. cheese has a nice little section and then crackers are found on top of the meat freezer. talk about disorienting. the prices here are winning though. super cheap and good quality. i do not mind the parking lot at all, mostly because i do not mind parking a bit farther and walking the extra couple minutes to and from the store. this place is just right for me, i might have to fit this little place in to my usual rotation of the earth fare and taj ma teeter near my house when i am out for groceries even if it is a little farther of a drive.","great wine selection among everyday low prices.","do not normally go to this trader

light, airy, and the glazed topping was not overkill. i had it a week ago and i am still thinking about it! the flavored donuts are of a cake consistency and the pumpkin was good. the pumpkin was a little more on the spice-y end of the flavor spectrum but still had good texture andre are more flavors to try so i am looking forward to my next visit!","great locally owned bakery!

employees and an array of cool sweet treats in a squeaky clean store, this place appeals to kids and adults alike. and, frankly, charlotte does not have very many ice cream shops to patron, so their competition is slim. mind you, i said *ice cream* not froyo. rita is custard is definitely not frozen yogurt. since i come from the midwest, i know what custard is. it is thick, it is smooth it is creamy and dreamy. overall, i like rita is custard...it definitely fills the void, but it does not hold a candle to the places i frequented when i was a kid. mmm culver is. anywho, while i enjoy the gelati (a combo of the custard and italian ice), the italian ice part almost send me into sugar shock. and i like sugar,, i will agree with others, the italian ice is a bit insane. a bit bright. neon, as dion says. but hey, i enjoy a bit of creamy vanilla custard on a warm summer day. do yourself a favor and get a smaller size...it is whole lotta sweet!","a rita is open year round and had indoor seating!  love this place!  it is amazing!the staff are friendly and great.  the place is clean as well as they always have different flavors, which is how it is with all ritas, they rarely have all of their flavors two days in a row.  and if you do not like the flavors for ices that day, you can always get a custard.  :dyums!","after thinking for years that i needed to try this place,  i finally

pickles and duck fat fries are very good as well.i was very unimpressed with the cavalier attitude given when they lost the credit card. no apology was offered when they discovered the card had indeed

southern cesar salad, both great. the flat bread comes with filet mignon cubed on every slice, carmelized onions and fresh mozzarella. this place is also a grocery but they are known for their cow pig sandwich: according to the menu it is a bacon burger with a large serving of bacon, sounds good but no one at our table ordered it, i am not one to mess with the already wildly successful formula of bacon on a hamburger. the southern cesar salad is a cesar salad but with cornbread croutons and a heavy serving of fried chicken. what is not to like about that. i would not hesitate to get either item again.","amazing... great find! wine and beer selection out of this world with the butcher on site- our new favorite place! my husband had the pork loin special and i had the yellowfin salad-

ingredients are all super fresh and the bagels have the right amount of crunch and chew to satiate any northerner looking to get their bagel and shmeer fix. they even have a whitefish salad and potato pancakes, yum! i personally have their waldorf chicken salad on an everything bagel that is the best lunch any day.","definitely my favorite bagel stop in charlotte.  we got a dozen for $10.  plus they have several varieties of cream cheese deliciousness.  i love the way the bagels are just the right balance of crunchy crispy on the outside and soft chewiness on the inside.","i absolutely love bagels. i know they are not the best for me and i do not care. they are just the perfect carb (which is certainly stiff competition). and i will admit, i am a bit of a bagel snob. what can i say? ny

often the case with a fine bagelry, you might want to ask them to go light on the schmear). sandwiches (both breakfast and otherwise). brewed coffee that does not taste like it came out of an unmentionable part of a dog.a dozen of poppy is finest may have found their way home with us after we finished our breakfast. and i may have eaten one every day this week. and i might have already

nationally renown brews in town! best merch i town! it is hard to go anywhere in the queen city and not see a reference to the noda brewery and there is a reason why. their product is the beast mode of craft brews. they need to improve their outdoor feng shui but they are overall an a+! you can not call yourself a native charlottean without visiting this place at least once.","first time there last weekend for the nc brewers & music festival preview featuring sol driven train.  it was a beautiful day, the side door was lifted open, the band was great, the people were friendly and the beers delicious.  i favored the ramble on red for a lighter beer, but then loved coco loco for a darker, richer flavor.  not a bad way to spend the afternoon.  i could see spending more warmer days here.","great neighborhood brewery, i truly felt at home the moment i walked through the door.  the people and beer make this place a success, and dogs are welcome which is a huge plus.","first time

was solidly in second place when it came to my rankings of charlotte breweries (behind the amazing birdsong brewery). their new beer, hot pistol, might help them edge out birdsong in my mind. this

wednesday nights which sadly, i have not been able to attend thanks to my work schedule, but ive heard its a lot of fun. they dont serve food but they often will have a delicious food truck parked out back (the tin kitchen is the best one). they dont stay open as late as most bars so go early so you can have your fill of yummy beer before the 10 pm last call","best run club in the city on wednesdays! social event of the weekalso their craft beer is no questions asked the best in the city. from favorites like hop drop and roll to new selections like the jam session pale ale and nodajito which is a tasty lime/mint infused beer, i am never disappointed in my post run beverages!","checked out of my hotel in charlotte and was recommended to check out this brewery. the brewers and staff were super friendly and recommended beers that i might like going by my regular choice of ipas and pale ales. everything was great, especially the hop drop n roll and the noda ryezed which was my favorite. got talking with one of the brewers and he recommended other breweries in the area for me to check out before my flight. great time and i highly recommend stopping by!","best microbrewery in charlotte by far. they make fantastic beer and have already won a national award for their hop drop and roll. the flavor combinations they try always seem to workout somehow and you will never get out of there without trying a couple different beers. if you are looking for a good beer that is from charlotte, definitely look for a noda beer!","excellent, fresh, tasty, creative beers. so glad to have this place in my backyard. great place to chill with a frosty beverage.","great bar with lots of beers and a friendly staff. a good place to go watch football on sundays. they have a huge selection of

owner present!great staffbrad is awesome!","best coffee i have ever had! who knew coffee did not have a bitter aftertaste? this is our new weekly stop even though it is way on the other side of town. so worth it.","fun environment and delicious coffee!  i had the vanilla sugar latte and my husband had the mocha latte.  both were tasty and had a nice balance of steamed milk and best part was just sitting at the counter for a while watching the baristas make designs on the lattes with steamed milk.  the beautiful multilayered hearts and rosettas were very impressive and take s lot of skill and hard work!","great coffee - had the macchiato and pour over rwanda. both great. macchiato was perfectly creamy and smooth. only improvement suggestion is better organization around knowing when your drink will be ready.","i am from out of town and whenever i am in town i come to this coffee shop and get the vanilla latte!! they make their own syrup and it makes the coffee taste so much better. very cool set up with local shops near by and nice to be on the bike path. nice ride and fantastic coffee.","a truly excellent cup of coffee. bold. flavorful. pour over coffee is the way to go. they brew each cup individually. friendly staff. the only reason i did not go 5 stars is that the shop is located in a  amarket place (food court kind of feel). it is nice, but if you are looking for that warm cozy coffe shop kind of feel, then it will leave you wanting. but, it is bright, open, and busy ambiance can be nice too if that is what your in the mood for. bottom line: i would come back.","heard about this place from a friend, best coffee in charlotte! the people are friendly too!","by far my favorite spot in charlotte for some good coffee! caramel lattes are my usual go-tos, but beware...their lattes will keep you feeling jittery all day long! sooo strong....yet sooo good!! do not be surprised by the long wait, especially on sunday mornings around church time. it is located inside the spacious 7th st public market next to various stands selling food, beer, spices and meats, so you will be kept busy while you wait on the barista to shout out your name. parking validation offered inside for the 7th st parking garage.","excellent coffee and great service. i normally sweeten my latte a little but theirs is so delicious it does not need it. their caramel and vanilla sugar lattes are wonderful as is the pour over coffees. they use and sell counter culture coffees.","7 dollars for a carmel latte and americano! very impressed with how they make the coffee and low the prices. also, they have almond milk which was great!","great coffee! it was a little hard finding it because we had no idea it was just a little island in the middle of 7th street market. but once you find it, you are in for a treat. we got the vanilla sugar latte which i loved because it was still sweet, but not cloyingly so. delicate balance of sweetness. it did not take too long for the barista to make our drink either, but we did go at an off-hour. great coffee.","definitely a trendy place to go and i must say the best late i have ever had. home made caramel and great roasted beans from counter culture. ca not go wrong here.","awesome little place in 7th street market. i was surprised by how busy the market was on a saturday at lunch. my wife got the caramel latte, and i got the vanilla sugar latte. i would have to say, hers was hands down better than mine. my was okay, but nothing really \"special\" so it, in my opinion. hers, however, had an incredibly rich caramel flavor (probably thanks to their made in house caramel sauce). we have all been around long enough to know that good coffee can be pricey, especially at these trendy type places. my only \"complaint\" is that for $Short for for in Short Message Service.50 + tax, i except a decent size beverage. the hot lattes seemed pretty small for the price. maybe it was so good we just drank them too fast? definitely worth your time though, maybe not just as a  aregular visitor.","great, unique, quality coffee. interesting, friendly staff who clearly care about the drinks they make. we waited 5-10 minutes for our drinks but it is well worth it. we stayed in charlotte for Short for for in Short Message Service nights and came here everyday.","i absolutely adore this place. i love coffee and lattes very much.  this place i go to when i want to treat myself to a nice/beautifully made caramel latte. i alway drink Meaning to in Short Message Service. i would drag anybody here who would come. my main project is my sis. she would enjoy their pour over coffee method and enjoy the environment all around. set in a farmer market right of the link, there is not a better location.  nice to see the familiar face. james is very knowledgable and passion about his coffee. and to listen to his humble story on how he got started. make me feel like there is hope for a minion like me in my small business. do yourself a hugh favor and stop by. give starbucks a break and tried them out. you will taste a differences. and fall in love.","hario pour over, counter culture beans, prime location and environment.  must visit!

ordered the vanilla \"sugar\" latte - no artificial  syrups used just real sugar. not too sweet either. 5 stars","$7 for a latte and a hot chocolate. both very sweet, creamy and delish. latte art even in our to go cups which was a nice touch. they have got counter seating with real mugs to stay or paper cups to go.","great place for coffee. the employees were outstanding i regard to customer service. dont forget to contribute to thier Short for for in Short Message Service01k fund. leave a gratuity ie tip","best coffee shop, hands down. their attention to quality is unbelievable. i will be moving soon for college and will miss this dime.. best coffee i have had in my life.","as always a great cup of coffee. james knowns his coffee. as my girl friend and i always try to make it down town you ca not skip this place, summer or winter it is the best place for a cup of coffee and the perfect place to soak in the atmosphere at the 7th street market","favorite coffee spot ever","decided to check this place out due to the other good reviews on yelp and glad i did! reviews are factual and coffee is worth making a visit.","as a loud and proud pnw raised, coffee lover: i am very critical of coffee. coming from a place where there is a coffee shop on every corner, it is hard for me to find enjoyable coffee. this place fits the bill! amazing roast, not too bitter, and does not give you those \"coffee shakes\". amazing taste, and beautifully presented. totally passes the \"seattleite\" test.","\"i do not always drink coffee but when i do i prefer not just coffee\"the caramel latte here is a must try. well balanced flavors and it is not overly sweet. it is just the perfect latte made with love by the great baristas behind the bar. i have only high praise for this establishment. the service is great and the coffee is nothing less than amazing. this is coffee done right!","for the love of macchiato! always takes me back by the knowledge here and the care for coffee.","great coffee with a personal touch.  i just wanted some standard coffee and not just coffee , was able to deliver with a personal touch.  their standard coffee is custom poured over by the cup.  they grind your beans specific to your cup and slowly pour water over it and filter it directly into your cup.if you have never had regular coffee this way, it is pretty great.","huge fan! we found this place on yelp and though we were only in charlotte for two days, made a point to head staff was predictably hipster and cool, but very friendly, and very knowledgeable and passionate about their work. i could sit at the bar for hours and just chat it up. the coffee bar is set in the middle of the 7th street public market - a feast for the eyes. i now know the best tea kettle and grinder to buy (hario!), how to make vanilla sugar, and what a cortado is.

compared to the other places i have tried this place is the yummiest. today we had the milk tea and strawberry smoothie. both yums. we also ordered a slice of the chocolate mousse cake. a tad too sweet but great if you are a mousse fan.  restaurant - today we ordered the beef noodle soup and a plate from the bar. beef noodle soup was plentiful with beef and was perfect a chilly day. hubs said it was too herby/mediciney for him but i thought it was great. we will pass on the bar next time and order a different entree. great options to work with and bright and spacious food areacery store:

moon festival time of the year and he variety of moon cakes was astounding. i bought the traditional al red envelopes for money tokens given to family members. all sorts of kitchen gadgets, decorations and books are piled haphazardly like in an outdoor market.  also many trinkets, crockery, and utensils. the produce section is huge and the prices are reasonable.","disclosure : i did not check out the grocery store. i only went to the bakery. i like how you can see them baking the goodies, that is always a plus. all of the baked goods were fresh, even at 5 in the afternoon. the area

their bubble tea, and possibly get something to eat from the eatery. look out for an updated review soon.","being the only asian supermarket in the area, i had high hopes. my parents go there all the time and i wanted to go check the place out. grand asia consists of a general grocery store (with fresh and packaged produce) as well as a bakery and dine in area. let me break it down forn you enter the supermarket, the dine in area is to the left. being the curious eater i am, i had to scope it out. it has a roasted meat area and a hot food area. all the food looked dried up like it has been there for awhile. moving on to the fresh produce. maybe because of the lack of competition, the price for vegetables/fruits were high and the quality was very low. this may seem unfair since i come from new york where asian supermarkets are being built back to back and there is competitive pricing and amazing quality. frankly, i was kind of grossed out how they could sell bruised fruits at such high prices. you loop around the store and you find the canned foods (alongside with snacks), fridge section (fish balls and ice cream yummm) and fresh fish and meats. pretty standard stuff. before you exit you will be able to feast upon the bakery section. now their baked goods are not bad but definitely ca not compare to new york baked goods. all in all, being the only asian supermarket in the area, i would have to come back if the craving hits. do i want to? no i do not. the service is awful, the place is always a mess and the quality is subpar.","few spices are cheaper than patels.","as a child, i remember frequenting the winn-dixie that once stood where grand asia market in stallings stands today.  unoccupied for many years, grand asia market utilized the vacated space to launch an asian grocery store as well as a restaurant one-third the size of their inventory runs deeps and their prices are surprisingly affordable.  their fish market offers an assortment of live and frozen fish including lobster and some obscure species.  remarkably, the prices of their frozen fish were very low, some as low at $Meaning to in Short Message Service.50/lb.  i do wonder if the quality of their fish is relative to the store and restaurant are clean and decorated.  i can really appreciate the culture at grand asia market; it is almost as though i have stepped over a continentallow-up: i

and lunch selections in the cafeteria line. the sushi maker is sweet and does a good job. the haba section is fairly large and enjoyable. it is one of the only places to buy gladrags- and that i will leave for your own discovery.","great smoothies at the juice bar. they also have some amazing prepared foods behind the counter. i was there this past weekend when spicey shrimp samples were out- first, they were not skimpy on the samples- a whole shrimp in each cup! and it was delicious. there is indoor and outdoor seating available. my friend and i sat outdoors and it was lovely to people

than the very limited south park location. there is no quality affordable rice in bulk though - only tiny overpriced main problem here is quality control in produce. all the garlic was moldy last time

slightly healthier when i am eating them even if it is purely psychological. what is great though is they have soo many variety. i would say earthfare is excellent before the whole whole foods hype rolled in. i wonder if they have lost some of their-customer base since the whole foods on fairview opened.  anyway, my point is earthfare will always be near and near my heart. it is a local organic goods store and i think organic goods does not get any better than local. earthfare also gives back to the community, they have various charity and nonprofit projects. i think a while back they had a kids in low-income family eat free day, going with the whole concept that no kids should go starving. it is good to know that you are shopping for a store with a great cafe section is amazing,

advertised sale times, to its bathrooms that make you long for a truck-stop port-o-potty, south park is earth fare is an embarrassment of a grocery store. the clerks are miserable (probably from long hours and low pay from what i have overheard), the place seems to be falling apart, and the overall vibe there is one of frustration and unhappiness.i used to love the burger bar, and they did away with it to make an overpriced bakery that no one shops at. the hot bar used to serve meatloaf, sweet potatoes, grilled chicken and more. now, when it is not just a pile of neglected, empty trays, it is a sea of dried fish and overcooked dark meat riddled with fat. whenever i make the mistake of going there (usually to avoid the crowds at the superior whole foods), i end up getting pizza at an insane price out of shame is that this, like most earth fare is i have been too, used to be pretty good. but the cut corners and bad management is painfully obvious. too many idiotic decisions have crumbled this company into a laughing stock among health conscious shoppers. the nearby harris teeter is a far better bet for a hot bar with good selection, and whole foods, being the wal-mart of the natural food industry when it comes to sheer size and dominance, can afford to buy in huge amounts to offer real savings to their customers compared to the poor selection and sky-high prices at any earth fare. as for supplements, i do vitamin shoppe which normally costs half... half... of what i pay at earth fare.as for their bogus \"declaration\" and behavior overall as a company, please take a look at all the horrible feedback employees have given them on. earth fare is in its death throes and i for one wo not be bothered with the funeral.","earth fare is a specialty grocery store with all

coffee! the caramel latte is amazing!bonus points for stocking bruks bars!","get a caramel latte, wait your turn, sit and sip. worth every penny. creamy, thick, sweet heaven.","great spot in charlotte

all of good quality. the same place is at the 7th street market and both are located in cute little markets. when it is warm, the open the side wall and it has a nice summer(y) feeling to it. highly recommend. potentially the best cup of joe in charlotte but the jury is still out!","great place for a latte!  staff were friendly and helpful!","as if atherton mill were not already the happening place on saturday mornings in south end, now not just coffee has kicked it up another notch.  rather than drive into uptown and fight traffic, i can easily park and grab a caramel latte or masala chai latte without any hassle.  i am typically not a regular coffee drinker, but there pour-over brew is the smoothest i have ever tasted.  the line on saturday mornings can be a bit long, but certainly worth the wait.","anyone who orders a pumpkin spice latte over not just coffee is caramel latte is a ridiculous human being."]},"Duckworth's Grill & Taphouse":{"name":"Duckworth's Grill &

stay away from the traditional pizzas (kind of blah, hence why they are are special quite a bit). great place to watch a game and have some drinks, but the service in the bar area can be hit or miss.

into my food, i could swear i tasted... lighter fluid? i do not know, something \"off\" about the ribs. they tasted chemical-like, not smoked. the cole slaw was warm, and also tasted slightly garlic

only way fried pickles should be done). the service is not great, when i asked the server if they had the blackberry cider i was looking for, she checked the tablet at the table, just as i had. we had to ask for a handful of things, like salt and more water. duckworth is is fine, but not my first choice, it is loud, loaded with tvs, but the pickles are good.","great beer selection. only place i

charlotte needs more locally owned ice cream shops, when i am on a hunt for simple ice cream there are barley any to pick from. i am not talking about soft serve or ice cream mixed with a million different candies.  ben/jer is anything but local, however they fit the bill. we made our way into the shop in the middle of a crazy summer thunderstorm and luckily we were the only people in the shop. i could not make up my mind on what to get so the simply sampled about 8 different flavors. the employee, ( i wish i had gotten his name) he was friendly and patient with my indecisive self. seriously, his ice cream recommendations were the best. i decided on strawberry cheese cake and a scoop of butter pecan. the portions are huge, the waffles cones were fresh and the service was sweet.","i always like driving by this ben & jerry is since it is right off of fairview and on the way home from a trip to southpark (for me).  it is a plus and minus at the same time since i can always feel the wheel of the car wanting to turn in and grab a cone orre are many flavors to choose from as well as a variety of options to take in ice cream from shakes to cones and sundaes... it is probably a good bed that you can find a flavor you like - plus they let you sample some if you ca not decide right then and there.my last visit, i was just driving through so i needed something that was pretty mobile.  i went with a shake... it was good, but i kinda felt a little cheated since the pictures on the menu versus what you actually get are a little misleading.  same goes for the regular cones and things... yes, it is ben & jerry is, but man i just wish it was priced a little better for the hard working joe-schmo like me.

 as with all chain restaurants i assume the average yelper has already formed a general opinion. starbucks is usually a love or hate for the consumer. while i personally like starbucks, i believe they are pricy for what they provide. i generally go when work is really hectic or i have a gift card. these past couple weeks have been the combination of both. this location is the only one on my commute to and from work, so it is my go to location. the wait for the wonderful dose of legal stimulant is not usually super long and the one time i had a frustrating wait they comped my coffee.my main complaint about this location is the food selection. i have not met one of their reheated sandwiches that i cared for, and this location is low on the healthy options. i have not seen the bistro boxes or parfaits in this location which would be my first choice if picking up food. i will occasionally have the petite vanilla scones (which is frequent out of stock item). confession - i am both terrified and hopeful that one day starbucks will make a whipped cream frappuccino.  whatever they put in their whipped cream is completely addictive.","avoid this starbucks at all costs. i am a teenager. yes, i understand that i am not an adult and that i may not be as important as the adults around me. that does not mean that the barista should tell me what i want in my drink and then act irritated when i ask her to fix it. i ordered a venti caramel iced coffee with cream and sugar. the barista preceded to tell me that the caramel would make the drink sweet enough and that i did not need the sugar in it. i asked for sugar, but she said i would regret it and refused to put sugar in my drink. there was no where for me to add my own sugar to the drink either. it was really frustrating. i get that i am a high schooler, and that you may have a better idea of what starbucks is good, and what is not. but please, let me order the drink that i have order for a while now. it was also crowded inside and there was no where for me to do my work. in the future, head to the davis lake starbucks. they are much much better.","dirty, if your not busy clean your damn store. your starbucks for crying out loud.  this is a small mall style chain inside a very clean, bright mall.  i have been to a mill is mall before in california and stores like this are what start the slow decline of what could be a great place to go.  starbucks... clean up your act!","great customer service...just wish it was bigger and had more seating.","great starbucks located in the south park harris teeter!

(hey, sb managers -- how about scheduling more employees for one of the busiest times of the day?)while waiting for almost 10 minutes for my simple, basic iced coffee (pouring it from a pitcher into a cup), i looked around the establishment.  they have recently renovated (again) and, if it is possible, there is even less seating to meet the demand of the number of people that frequent this particular restaurant.  for one thing, there are fewer individual tables.  for another, there are not enough chairs to even accommodate those tables.  there were empty tables with no chairs around them!  they have also gone with the space-hogging long community tables, like anyone who goes to sb with a book, laptop, friend, etc. wants to sit closely with another party.  one thing that used to make sb great was the intimacy it provided for its patrons.  i guess that is out the refurbished window.  the drink delay also gave me a chance to get a really good look at the cleanliness of the tables, and especially the common area with the cream, sugar, etc.  it was not replenished and filthy.  fil-thy.  the garbage was overflowing onto the counter.  it looked abandoned.  someone really needed to get out on the floor (hello, manager again!) and clean. things. up.   the outside seating was not much cleaner.  every time i go to this starbucks, it seems like they have renovated again, but it seems like when they do, they always miss big opportunities:  more seating, more staff, cleaner facilities.  starbucks should reasonably be embarrassed by this store.","absolutely the worst service. every time i come in i am greeted by the scowling faces of, what must be, the most unhappy indentured servants ever. this morning, instead of calling my name the lady making drinks just left my iced latte on the counter and walked off. really? i have had bad service here before, but this tops it. shame on yall, i should have gone to dunkin down the street and paid half price for the same damn thing.","apparently this is the starbucks to go to if you are looking for peace, quiet and lots of seating!

establishments in the queen city is astounding. in the hierarchy of quality, however, yoforia lands just ahead of tcby. i have been there no less than 15 times and the yogurt is typically either icy or runny, never with the smooth consistency characteristic of higher quality yogurt. the toppings, although not as gross as tcby, are plentiful but usually too large to be mixed in properly. there is, however, a large variety of toppings from cereal to fruit to sprinkles.i do not personally enjoy yoforia (i am a tasty-yo and pinkberry fan), but i took my friend is 5-year-old daughter here once and she loved being able to choose her own toppings and mix yogurt flavors. i would be remiss if i did not mention the service. i understand that it is self-serve, but it is really difficult to get an employee to come out of the back and offer a sample cup or even say hello when i have come in at off-hours. really disappointing, compared to other yogurt places, where the staff is exceptional and engaged. i appreciate that extra humane they remodeled and put in more bathrooms so fire code allowed for the outdoor seating, that became a plus. all in all, if it is variety and mediocrity you are after, yoforia is your place. it makes 5-year-olds deliriously happy. but then again, so do dora and diego.","how far this yoforia has fallen since it opened. yoforia used to tout organic, healthy

crowds its topping bar with \"wet walnuts\", capn crunch cereal and tons of gross, sugary, high-fructose-corn-syrup laden nastiness. the fresh fruit that is left -- and there is very little of it --

seen these guys around town, at festivals and food truck rallies, but had not had the pleasure of checking them out. they were camped out next to noda brewing one evening and it was just perfect. beer and a food truck. modern pb&j. the prices are waaaaayyyy cheaper than i thought they were going to be. ended up getting the tarragon chicken soup (i had a bit of a cold), a black bean burger and some seasoned fries. all for about $Zero hand (online gaming).the black bean burger was one of the most unique i have had in town. where the burger itself had a less than desirable texture, the flavors were great. there had to be some sort of sriracha or chili cream sauce on it. the spice was great and all of the flavors worked very well together. the tarragon chicken soup was awesome. flavorful broth, but not overpowered by tarragon, with huge portions of chicken and rice. i was a happy camper with my soup opening a can of whoopass on my cold. take that, winter! also, much to my glorious surprise, it came with a half sammy. just a simple grilled cheese, but it was so good. the fries: just great. that is all. did not need ketchup. another perk is that you can pay with square on an ipad. the fact that you add a tip and sign yourself is much more intuitive for a food truck. glad to see so many people have adopted this method. i am looking forward to the next time i get to sample the fare from herban legend.","have been checking out the local trucks recently, of the 5 i have triedthis is the best. creative menu, well seasoned, and i second chester isthought on the shawarma, and the prices seem better than the others.i finished my shawarma, and started to drive away, it was so good i drove a few blocksback to get another..... ca not remember the last time i did that....","ate herban legend for the first time today at lunch.  overall the food was good.  my only complaint would be the portion size for the money.  i am a frequent customer of other charlotte food trucks and i am used to getting pretty large portion sizes.  for example: the tin kitchen will serve you two good size tacos as well as a side (salad, chips & salsa, rice, etc.) for the same price as you will get at the herban legend.  it is convenient that they park outside of our building, however i may consider heading down the street a few min to get some tin kitchen the next time so i can get more for my money.","\"yay!

while cash is preferred, he does accept credit cards. when you see this giant blue truck, you will definitely want to stop and get a meal. you will receive friendly service as well!","for food truck fare - the herban legend was the best i have had to date.  and on the night of the noda food truck rally in mid-february, i \"gorged\" on three different food truck vendors.  i also like that the heban legend has a speaker system playing out some jams while you wait for your food.my favorite was the chicken shawrma, complete with tabbouleh and deliciously marinated chicken.  even though the new york times likes to diss truffle oil used on food, the parmesan truffle fries were awesome.i did not have room left for the sri lankan curry, but that is definitely happening next time i get the chance to enjoy the herban legend is food.","good stuff.i had to look to find it as the truck  was hidden behind a bar in elizabeth, but the wife and i are quite glad we did. it is a two person operation, the chef and his sister, but thankfully there was no line and quick service.we shared fries, which were, well.... fries.  nothing particularly special there.  but then the sandwiches, the delicious, taste-bud pleasuring sandwiches!  i had the chicken shawarma, and it was so beautifully seasoned, with all the meet and veggies and sauce evenly spread throughout the flatbread (think, lightly toasted, thicker than a wrap, thinner than a pita).  it was simply spectacular.  unfortunately, my wife had the black bean burger.  i say unfortunately because she is now convinced that she wants to be a vegetarian.  it was evidently that damnt else?  prices are great, particularly for the quality of the food.  the folks were super pleasant, since we were the only customers we spent a bunch of time talking with them about good eats in charlotte.  the ambience, obviously, depends on the location.  we were at a bar which was nice as we could have a tipple to quench our watering-mouths.highly, highly recommended!","herban legend is our food truck go to!","chanced by this truck the other day while driving back home with bread from amelie is and decided to give it a shot.  the truck was parked right outside of noda brewing co.i settled on the muffaletta sandwich and the fish and chips to take home for me, my wife, and our little one to muffaletta was pretty good, but it was made into a pressed panini-tye of sandwich.  i am still looking for a good nola central grocer style muffaletta up north (north of nola, that is) and so far jason is deli comes the closest.  but still, the herban legend version was a tasty fish and chips, on the other hand, were awesome.  probably the best i have had in charlotte, and that includes the crepe cellar.in addition, the people running the truck were very friendly and cool, and were willing to recommend their favorite dishes, which always helps (do not you hate it when the staff at a restaurant are ambivalent about the menu choices?).i am looking forward to trying this truck again before too long.","herban legend was at triple c brewery one night... ok... you have to try the shawarma. really it is that good. and i am pretty skeptical.my only knowledge of shawarma before was a reference i saw to it in the avengers movie. the crew tell me that shawarma make up more than half of their food have to try this it is that awesome!"]},"Beef Jerky Outlets":{"name":"Beef Jerky Outlets","longitude":"-80.7115061","latitude":"35.3649359","reviews":["great selection of beef jerkey and turkey jerkey in plain flavors up to mega spicy!

i always love going away with a good deal on a greatrall, i like this grocery store.","as the harris teeter closest to my house, it has the most check-ins. as far as harris teeter is go, this one is probably one of the fanciest i have been to. it has a wine/beer bar near the deli, where you can catch the game, or just buy a glass of wine to take with you while shopping. because of the location in ballantyne it can get very busy which can be irritating most of the time, but that is why there is wine. they have a big produce section that can be hit or miss. they have a great deli with a lot of friendly people, but that can get very busy as well. basically if you feel yourself getting irritated, go grab a glass of wine, and keep walking.","full service atmosphere and very clean.   they have what you want and will order it if they do not. the company is very civic minded and gives a lot to schools and charities.*side note* food is a little on the pricey-side in this area, compared to chicago and new york. i am sorry the \"cost of living is so much cheaper in the south\", does not apply in charlotte.

well, when you are as close as you can be to looking like a higher end grocery store, you earn it, i guess. i wo not bother with the \"i remember when.....\" stories about this location. sure, it was a great location for pm residents before and (guess what) it still is. they have made some massive improvements, though. the parking situation is hilariously better than what it was. it was awful before. it is not great now, but it is light years better than what it was. also, it is clean. really clean. coolers, aisles run in both directions, tons of space in the back for the deli/seafood counter(s), and even outdoor/upstairs dining/lounge areas. the aesthetic alone from the exterior makes it stand out. they kind of went with the \"old timey\" appeal with some of the signage/decor. i dig it. it gives plaza a nicer, more neighborhood-y feel, in my opinion. end of the day, it is still just a harris teeter. however, it is definitely one of the more unique locations in crown town.","from now on, i am nicknaming the store \"the dirty harry t\" because i saw Meaning to in Short Message Service disgusting things today. the 1st involved a team member in produce picking broccoli up off the floor (where your feet and dirty rugs go) and placing it back into the bin to be sold. it was beyond the 5-second rule and she did not even dust it off. murder most foul! i literally almost vomited. she also could not help me find plantains, but that was beside the point. all of this happened around 10:Short for for in Short Message Service8 am today - check your security cams ht. also, someone working on the fresh sushi sneezed on his gloved hands and went right back to work without changing gloves or anything. gross! sushi with a side of random virus. ack! this is not my usual ht but i was in the area and needed a few things before the forecasted winter storms. i am hoping that i do not *have* to go back. also, i am willing to admit that peak cold and flu season, ameatur grocery shoppers (teens hanging out and not buying anything), and mid-day restocking for the store probably contributed to the less-than-desirable conditions.","fantastic! quick morning grocery run on the way to work uptown. no hassle and the parking deck rocks when it is raining. great salad bar and fruit is so satisfying every time.","did the first review on here seriously say this is smaller than the other harris teeters?

i really want to go back to nc with the sole purpose of coming back here.","awesome new space!!!  checked it out the other night and i was not disappointed.  i had heard good things and birdsong definitely delivered.  to be completely honest, i had no idea where they had moved until one day i was driving towards noda and got rerouted with that detour and stumbled upon their newre is ton is of room in the tap room with a unique spoke-like high top setup and then lower tables skirting the outside of the floor next to the windows.  so many windows!  the light coming in from outside was nice as well as a nice connection with the outdoor seating area.  the bar area (where the \"spokes\" are radiating from) super cool, tons of seating and chalkboard space to advertise their brews and what is going on in the space.i did not take a brew tour, but they look to have tons of space in the back and even a side selling area for merchandise (t-shirts, etc).  probably my biggest gripe in my first impression of their new digs is the parking lot.  maybe i just chose a bad night where everyone drove separately, but it was almost like a demolition derby out there.  the parking lot out back is not necessarily connected to the front (most obvious lot), but there are still a lot of spaces.  it also could have been their food truck setup for that night where the imperial sandwich co took more spaces than needed.  other than that... great to have birdsong in their new space (closer to uptown) and not right next door to  noda.  i did see some of the noda brew runners stop by here after their run (no judgement...)  i would probably do the same if the other tap room was super crowded.","awwh birdsong.. i know i came to you primarily because i first went out to noda brewing and wanted to keep the party going so i clammered in after a coco loco. but you really made my night! i appreciated your smaller bar area and your uniform decor. the consistency and cohesion resulting from the slightly altered repitition in your interior space made me feel comfortable and secure. i also enjoyed the cozy bar itself. some might say it was cramped, but i like being in people is faces.. it made for a more intimate setting which is nice in a bar because it eminates a more communal feel.i even made a new friend! patrick! hi, patrick! see, its important for a bar to be a little cramped. and i got to have one of the last pours of the jalapeno beer! ooo it was terrific and no heartburn! i really look forward to the next time we meet, birgsong.","had a wonderful time at birdsong brewery on a sunday afternoon. i had a pint of the jalepeno pale ale which was like nothing i have had before. we chatted with the lady behind the bar and some charlotte locals. it was a great atmosphere with friendly people and excellent beer!

cream.. had a good time \"hangout\" with the owner during charlotte coffee crawl event.. definitely a coffee shop you need to stop when you are in the area.","i am a avid coffee drinker and the coffee quality and taste is very important. my lady told me about this place called noda and smell cat popped up. with a list of great reviews i had too try it out. starbucks can only thrill a coffee lover so much till we need a new unique taste. this place has a amazing ambience and atmosphere. you will notice private tables and their coffee roaster right in the middle of the store. i have tried two of their blends, black cat being my favorite. i took a bag of llorana home which was a little darker. very good roasted coffee. i highly recommend. only problem, too far from my house.","any time i get coffee anywhere else (*cough*starbucks*cough*), i regret not going to smelly cat. they make great espresso drinks, amazing hot chocolate and brew great coffee. the staff is friendly and the atmosphere is really chill. a great place to sit and do some work or hang out with friends.","great iced chai latte.  love the atmosphere of this place... very cozy and personal.  the artwork on the walls and also all the fllyers of the \"what is happening\" in the noda scene are great conversation starters as well as just keeping up with the local art scene.in my last visit i noticed chess boards and checkers on the shelf which you can play with... not plastic/cheapo sets, but sets with character... wood with metal pieces.  i bet there are more games, but i only saw these inff was super friendly and my latte was unique tasting (in a good way).","great , friendly atmosphere. they brewed a pour over i requested , excellent! best coffee i have had in chatlotte. they roast the coffee in the shop.","good coffee, good shakes, good pastries, good people, great atmosphere. i heart smelly cat!","bar none, this is my favorite coffee house in the charlotte metro area. they capture the neighborhood feel of noda perfectly. having recently moved out of the area the one thing that i miss the most are my daily trips to smelly cat.i have been coming here for many years and i have to say that the group of people that work here are amazing. forgive me if i misspell  anyone is name....tony seems to have the roasting business mastered as he roasts all of their beans in house. not only do i go for a cup daily but i also buy all of my beans for home from here. tony really influenced my love for this place as he immediately learned my name , my favorite type of roast and it felt to me like each time i stepped in the door that i received amazing service from him. this stretches throughout all of the staff ( the rachels are the same, super attentive , wonderfully kind and they go out of their way to make my visits great). on top of this the owner is a frequent face within smelly cat and within the local noda community. she is as pleasant as anyone i have met and i can tell that she has put her stamp on the culture of this business. i sometimes wonder how they are able to keep such a quality staff of people as you do not find this within many businesses, it clearly stands out! i will be ordering all of my beans on line from now on and i have already figured out a away to steer my workday through noda a couple times a week just so i can still enjoy my favorite spot. the atmosphere is great, the staff are great and the coffee is great...thanks smelly cat crew!!!-cameron","first of all there is no smelly cat at this place which is not bad after all.i asked one of their staff. she said she does not know why the coffee place is named as smellyer mind! place is great, well located. even with my limited knowledge about noda, i can tell that it is located in the center of the noda district, if there is any center. well, there has to be a centre, right? ;-)coffee is good, service is nice, staff is friendly. i go here whenever i am in and around noda district. it is a great place to sit and relax while having a coffee. sometimes on sundays it is quite which makes relaxation, reading and browsing internet much more peaceful.","great service from attentive baristas who have not learned to burn coffee like starbucks, and also fail to give a convincing apathetic attitude to suggest they are only doing this until their art sells to a generous patron.  in fact, smelly cat has easy off street parking in a fashionable neighborhood, and is an enjoyable place with good bakery items.  they may learn to be disappointing someday, but for now they actually measure up.  get there soon, or do not.  then i will get more coffee.","coffee not at a chain is hard to find in charlotte. i love buying local and on my days off. i am more than willing to drive the extra ten minutes to get it. the coffee is the best i have found in town and the service is equally great.","awesome coffee shop. went there to start our date night. we got a sweet new orleans cold brew and my bride got the spiced brown sugar latte. we also got a slice of the zucchini bread and a morning glory muffin. super tasty. we will be back.","great little place in noda. super cozy and warm. i am particularly a fan of this place in the fall and winter.","absolutely perfect. free wifi great coffee and great atmosphere.","cool location and the best cup of coffee on our trip. cool shirt and mug bought there too, but a bit pricey for the swag ringing us up was very apathetic, but that was her and did not affect the product one bit. would definitely come back if passing through again.","great area (noda). i am a full time student, and this is an incredible place for me to come, kick back, and study for a little while. the coffee is delicious, though a bit overprices compared to some of the competition in theinitely recommend if you are wanting to try something new and unique.","entered smelly cat for the second time in my life the other day (first visit was a group meeting back when i was getting my mba, and i am trying to block that craziness from my mind, so this review is only for my most recent visit). what a wonderful little coffee shop. if i lived in noda, i would definitely support this small business instead of hitting up the big chains. the atmosphere is quite cool and laid back, and the staff was beyond wonderful. they had a ton of pastries and what looked like a mouth watering carrot cake, but i was there for one reason, and one reason only...caffeine.nicole w (being the fantastic community manager that she is) raved to me about the pour over coffee, so at yelp is passport to noda event earlier this week, i hightailed it over there to check it out. the wonderful cathy (what a great name, huh?) walked us through the process of pour over coffee, which creates a very smooth cup o joe. i thoroughly enjoyed the lesson and my caffeine - with some steamed almond milk and honey. very, very good. if you have the time to wait, i highly recommend checking it out. and to support the business even further, i purchased a nice little pullover. there are t-shirts, sweatshirts, and other items for sale with the logo and location on them. i love me some quirky little gear. head on in to smelly cat and sit inside if the weather is not good, or grab one of the outdoor tables and soak up some vitamin d. either way, you can feel good about supporting a small business in your area.","by far the best customer service i have ever had..hands down.  my husband and i went here for the first time today after i had heard some great things about this coffee shop.  i ordered the iced dirty chai latte which they are known for.  i personally was not a fan of it..there was some sort of spice in there that did not agree with me.  i want to note that many many people love this drink so i encourage you to still try it even though i did not care for it.  i do not believe it was anything they did wrong it just was not my personal favorite.  i was a little nervous to ask for my money back but figured i would at least ask since i knew i was not going to be able to drink it.  cathy (the owner) was extremely nice.  she asked if they could remake it for me or if i wanted to try something else on top of her giving my money back for the drink..i told her that was okay (i already felt bad for returning the drink!). then on top of that she encouraged me to come back and try something else and the drink would be on the house.  i have never received such great customer service and encourage anyone to give this place a try.  the next time i am in the area i will try a different drink.  they also roast their own coffee and offer almond and soy milk which i appreciate since dairy milk does not agree with my stomach.  terrific owner!","blackberry frappe is my favorite but i tried their cortadito cubano today and it definitely gets my hispanic stamp of approval!  i have no reservations about this shop. great staff, helpful coffee tips for us noobs, great music, and a warm vibe that inspires creativity.","great cozy work spot, but very little in the way of food.  just pastries and bagels.","being a professional coffeesnob.  this made me happy.  great service, the best cap in charlotte, and a great place to hang out.  i went to all the coffeehouses in charlotte this won!!","great coffee, great service and nice environment.  must try the dirty chai, pour over coffee and peanut butter bar is to die for.","funky little place. been driving by here for ever and always wanted to stop. friendly staff, typical coffeehouse menu. got the toasted coconut frapp. yummo!! i will have to stop in more often.","i am actually kind of heartbroken that i have lived in charlotte for so long and never made it out here until today.  this place is awesome, it is the exact kind of coffee-haven that charlotte needs more of, and it is situated in the cool streets of noda.  the staff is helpful and engaging, the atmosphere is really conducive to quality conversations but also provides great space for someone who needs to plop down and grind out some work.  more importantly though - my drink was fantastic, and their in house bagels are phenomenal!  this place could definitely be my new go-to coffee place.","a cute little spot hidden in noda. love meeting friends here for coffee or just catching up on some laptop work here.","beautiful sunday morning, artsy little cafe, sun shining, hot sweet chai, people enjoying the day inside and out. the door partitions between booths are just as cool as other reviewers said. i look forward to trying other beverages and hanging out...","a very friendly staff and the most delicious hot chocolate i have ever had.","do not let the name fool you, they have great coffee all around.  and they have soy milk for non-dairy people.  very cozy atmosphere.  cool booths made out of antique doors.  a down home kitchen feel but equally appropriate for coffee snobs who would like to go somewhere besides starbucks for a change.  not that i have anything against starbucks, but i am looking forward to visiting smelly cat again.","am usually not a coffee person... but yest we had some time to while awa and tot vll check out this coffee shop...though the name doesn appeal at all, i must say for a change i enjoyed drinking coffee..ordered a cappuccino without any added flavor...it smelled good..and tasted nice!!also picked up their house made muffins...a craneberry orange muffin..it was delicious...actually pieces of fruit to bite on...i loved it. the ambience is also nice for some one to just sit and read or listen to some music while enjoying a good cup of coffee.","coffee selection is amazing!  i just wish they had as good of a selection of parking spots. we had to resort to street parking.  once inside, the environment is quirky and eclectic.  the space was cozy, although at times felt a tad too small.  my friends and i went to smelly cat to work on a project.  as soon as we arrived, we realized that this was not the kind of coffee house you could be productive at.  due to the size restrictions, which hence, make the table sizes smaller, we had to enjoy our delicious coffee and relocate.  service was friendly and the atmosphere was super chill.  i would go back for some schmooze time!","after being contacted by the owner through yelp, i had to up my rating. this is my local coffee shop, and i thought i loved it before, my biggest complaint being they do not serve breakfast sandwiches. well not too long after writing my review the owner contacted me via message letting me know they have added bfast wraps to the menu!! stopped in to grab a bacon, egg & cheese and a kona brew, and left a very happy camper. this is the difference between local business and corporations, good local business listen to the needs/wants of their consumer and adapt. kudos smelly cat, and thank you cathy!","first time going to this coffee house. i have heard so much about this place so i thought i give it a try. it was amazing! i had the dirty chai with soy. very good and very nice people. i will be going back for sure.","great friendly neighborhood coffee shp","great spot.my fav kind of coffeet there this morning after show last night across the street at neighborhood theatre(another great venue!)friendlyatr pastry,but i did not go there for the pastry!next time i am in charlotte, i will hit up the cat!","great coffee. lovely ambiance. great place to catch up with friends or take a few moments out of your day to unwind. also, the artwork changes out, so you get

will have to ask what the flavors. i had the oreo flavored one which was a vanilla cupcake base with what appeared to be oreos in the batter with and oreo frosting. it definitely seemed like a good

uncomfortable.  but, never fear, because we were able to exchange them for padded chairs with backs.  our server was friendly,and he gently offered helpful suggestions.  my husband ordered the stout,

garlic, tomatoes, basil and a fig-balsamic vinegar reduction.  the spinach-artichoke dip was creamy and had a nice cheese crust.  the fig-balsamic reduction had a slight sweetness to it, but not overly so.  looking forward to returning!","after much anticipation, heist has finally opened their glorious doors to the culinarily savvy of noda and beer-craving crowd of the greater charlotte population. you would not suspect much out of this old mill turned bar, turned animal hospital, turned brewery, but the decor, service, adventurously ridiculous menu, brews, house-made sodas and potential will make you turn your head more than once. first, the decor alone will cause your jaw to drop. the layered wood lining the walls is just outstanding. the pattern it creates draws your eye to being the first thing you see. the main entrance houses a full bar and the booth seating has a gorgeous high back of finished wood. looks like a dark cherry. absolutely gorgeous. the chandelier is made of the extra brass pipes from the brewing gear with bullet holes blasted through them! so rad. you can bet that will show up on pinterest soon....service is incredible. there are so many different places to sit -- outside deck, upstairs, main room, tap room -- and the servers ring it up and send it fast. three different bars to order from, too. we ordered the iMeaning to in Short

choices, too. next time we are in, we will have to order a few flights to check out the rest of the lineup. blueberry blonde? sounds crazy interesting!the menu is just.....insane. not only from a perspective of fusion, presentation, and taste, but the story behind each menu item. each item has it is own little quirk and style.we started with the pretzels and spinach artichoke dip. the presentation of both is stupendous. pretzels were a little on the firm side, but the beer cheese made up for it. very nice flavor on the cheese. the spinach artichoke dip was lovely. served with a flatbread of sorts, and housing huge chunky artichoke hearts. this did not last long as we scraped every inch of the bowl. would order both again in a heartbeat.  i ordered the brewmaster burger. a mix of porterhouse and brisket. what? who in the history of burger-dom has mixed porterhouse and brisket?! it was incredible. served on brioche, the few standard burger accoutrement, and rosemary tots. these jokers are Meaning to in Short Message Serviceoz tots. creamy, savory and chewy. the smokiness of the burger was to die for. it was not overt, but just subtle enough to inhabit my palate throughout the meal. my wife ordered the veggie sandwich. all smokey, grilled veggies on focaccia. a rather hearty sandwich. she ordered the creamed corn with it. man. talk about rib-sticking corn! very creamy and huge corn flavor. we ended up ordering dessert as well. we had to sample one of the house made sodas! went with the orange creamsicle float and the blondie. both were knockouts. the house-made orange soda was incredible. i ca not wait to check out the rest of the lineup. the blondie was just as it should have been. warm, topped with ice cream, and plenty of rum-infused caramel. what a nice cap to the meal. heist may still be new, but they are showcasing some serious talent all around. these guys hit every sense and beckon for you to dive deeper into the complex menu, both beer and food. these guys will grow and continue to show charlotte something it has never had before. welcome to the neighborhood, heist!","i am from miami and the thought of eating chicken and waffles never seemed appealing to me, then i went to heist. not only is the place huge so i have never had to wait to be seated, i like that, but the beer selection, great decor, and food make hb even

are so cool. my favorite drink is their black fog (beer cocktail), it is dark and delicious. but the best thing about this place is the food, and the menu is impressive. this is not your average giant pretzel and beer cheese menu, although i love a giant pretzel and you can get that here is well ;-). they have everything from lobster mac to duck flatbread. on my recent visit i had the elderberry seared scallops on avocado mouse and dust-banana eggrolls for desert. the presentation was beautiful and the taste amazing. the atmosphere is very light and versitile perfect for a group of friends/coworkers or a stress free first date.","hmm, reading some of the reviews, i disagree with opinions on the beer. i thought the beer was really good. i agree that the food is a bit pricy and small, but delicious and interesting. the burgers are awesome. the decor is great as well. they do tend to be \"reservation nazis\", i have seen 50+ empty seats with reserved signs that stayed reserved for Short for for in Short Message Service5 minutes plus, some never filled at all. i never knew empty tables were profitable.","awesome menu full of unique selections and a nice variety of beers and cocktails. the outdoor seating is very nice and has a very relaxed casual feel. inside there are high ceilings and a more industrial feel that includes glass windows which allow patrons to see the brewery in action! great stop in noda.","great spot. good beer. better food. the pour on the beer flights is generous, which is awesome. love the decor and the feel of the place. it is not really set up for sipping and socializing (standing), which was a drawback for me, since i was only there for a beer with friends and family, not a meal.","got here early in time for the beginning of their \"not so small batch\" beer release (apparently every monday) which is awesome since we were able to interact with bartender (btw maggie is great! made us out-of-town visitors feel right at home) and hang out. great atmosphere, great beer craftsmanship and service!well played, charlotte! when we are in town, we will be back!","heist brunch is awesome! great breakfast buffet filled with bacon ham and sausage. grits were amazing and awesome add on entree. i would definitely recommend you trying it out!","came here for brunch and it was good.  they have a small buffet style serve yourself items,  desert and fruit bar, and some breakfast juices.   the real trick to brunch is to get the included custom made omelettes and waffles.   you fill out a form and they custom make your breakfast.   i got a omelette with hugs and snuggles ( i have no clue what it was) and it waso, if you come here for brunch make sure you time it right so you can get the bottomless mimosa is. they do not serve them before noon.","first off, the place is gorgeous.  rustic, charming.  you can smell the wood-burning oven.  it is cozy, inviting.  i was not in a hurry to waitress was okay.  not terribly friendly.  i felt as though we were bothering beer was pretty good.  not the best, not the worst.  nothing terribly noteworthy, but i would sit down with another glass of succession with ach brings me to the food.  wow!  clearly not an afterthought.  beer cheese burger on pork belly brioche?!  who does that?!  ah-mazing.  (pro-tip:  add bacon jam.)  and parmesan truffle fries - to die for.  i would mainly go back for the food and the atmosphere & have a beer while i am there.  although, if you are mainly just looking for a really good beer, this may not be the best of choices.  go there for the food, stay for the beer.","heist is the only brewery in noda with a dine in restaurant, so regadless it is always a \"must\" when hopping between bars/breweries in the area. however; i am only in \"like\" with the establishment. the beer is fine, but there are other, better breweries in the area. they all have a similar flavor, and they do not seem to have any good unique flavors yet. also, i would love to see more vegetarian or vegan options on the menu. right now i am stuck only eating the beer cheese, since they keep removing the veggie options from the menu. with that being said, i will still continue to be a regular at this establishment. the beer cheese is honesty amazing, the atmosphere is fun and relaxed, and although there are better beers in the area, heist beers are still good. i have always had a great time at heist.","disappointing food. i ordered a cheeseburger flatbread and had maybe 1 ounce of beef on the entire flatbread, when i mentioned it to the manager not only did he make it right , he threw in a free desert. i appreciate that he made things right with no questions or quibbles and with a cheerful attitude. the second flatbread was perfect. the free desert was an especially nice gesture.","been here a couple of times, the beer and plate sharing on patio seating was nice during summer time. i then went there for the much loved sunday brunch one fall day and it was not amazing. service was good, food was decent but to me it seemed overpriced for what was served. maybe if was an off day so i will give it one more chance but not as excited as i originally was.","cool vibe inside - mostly high tops.  cozy little patios would be nice in spring and fall for sure.  lots of tvs and screens for sports. beer is delicious.  it is nice that they have food, since most of the breweries in the area do not...but, the food is very heavy.  everything we ordered was spicy and/or super rich.  maybe we made the mistake of going to eat for lunch instead of dinner.  it was just a super heavy meal.","i absolutely love this place - it has become my new go-to place in noda. the beer is great and the food is fun. i have not made my way through the whole menu yet but i am working my way through it. some of my faves are the pork belly corn dogs, flatbreads and their homemade focaccia bread is great. my only complaint is that i ca not rate it any higher!","great brews, pretty good food but food is way overpriced.  served in portions of tapas with a range of  $8-16, which is the price of a full meal.","great food, extremely mediocre three stars is a reflection of the food.  if i were rating the beer alone, i would have rated 1-Meaning to in Short Message Service star, and if on the food alone, Short for for in Short Message Service-5 stars.we sampled quite a few dishes:  the chicken&waffle sushi, the forked up tuna, the pork belly corn dogs, the torched diablos, and the jerk mango chipotle wings.  all of the dishes were excellent and beautifully presented.  the forked-up tuna was the star of these in my beer on the other hand was very uninspired.  i tried a flight of 5 beers (stout, brown porter, red, pale ale and the maibock) plus a pint of the hefeweizen.  all were very bland, flat and lacked flavor across the board.  i would rate the brown porter as the best of the worst, but i would not recommend any of them.  service was very friendly and attentive.  shame the beer was the lone negative point.","did a noda brewery bar crawl one day with friends....and started at heist for lunch and drinks. we got the duck flatbread with root beer bbq sauce and the pork belly corn dogs. both were super savory. the pork belly in the corn dogs was nice and juicy...combo that with one of their great beers and you are a happy person. my friend got some of the chicken wings, which were ok, did not get much meat from them. tried a sampler of beers. my favorites were the hefeweizen and the amber ale. next time i go i want to try some of the specialty cocktails. nice atmosphere on the inside, but get there a little early because the place fills up fast. we also came to heist for the roaming dinner relish carolina and got some awesome cocktails from the bar manager who was super friendly and creative with his drinks. definitely will be back again!","great beer. so-so food. seriously, why would you serve hummus and goat cheese in toothpaste-esqu tubes. the bruschetta was over the top in terms of quanity but kinda flavorless.  good beer cheese. beer is fantastic, i will be back for that.","Short for for in Short Message Service stars based on the service and atmosphere.  i absolutely love the interior of this place.  very shaby chic and trendy at the same time.  we popped in for a quick beer the other night and this place was completely packed out!  that is a good sign.  i tried the local ipa brewed there and while it was completely drinkable i was not overly in love with it.  maybe that will grow on me.  the food being delivered to the tables around us looked great and for that reason alone i will have to go back and give the food a go!","came here for sunday brunch, i was impressed with their unique selections in the brunch buffet. also unlimited mimosas for $10 so ca not go wrong there. our waitress was great too, she never let us run out of drinks!","amazing food and drinks! stephan the bar tender is knowledgeable and highly talented bar man/mixologist","going to keep this review brief..we went to heist on a thursday night, there was a good size crowd so my boyfriend and i sat at a high top table. we each tried a few beers and they all had great flavor. the food is small plates/tapas style.. definitely great for sharing. the man and i shared a flatbread made with duck and homemade root beer bbq sauce, slider trio, and pretzels with beer cheese dip. everything was delicious, fresh, and made from scratch. definitely a great place to go with a group since it is open, loud, and almost everything on the menu is shareable!","hands down the best brunch in the city. it has become my go to place for bringing visitors to town on sunday mornings.","from out-of-town ca not believe how good the food is almost like a five-star restaurant","beer is not good. tastes watered down.  got the pork belly corn dogs and it was all fat not meat, literally, i am not exaggerating.  the people are nice and the atmosphere is very cool. i would only come here for the flatbread.  also, most of their seating is high top stools with no backs. not very comfy for a meal.","fun, funky place. great food, a good signature drink is the moscow mule/texan mule. relaxed atmosphere with a good feel, nice servers.","decently done craft brews. nothing amazing nothing bad. their flavors are a little over powering and it tastes a little more like a home brew than a brew house. but the atmosphere is great and service friendly and knowledgeable about the beers they serve.","first time in charlotte and found this place. i had the lobster mac n cheese. it was good and just good.  the waitress was nice and helpful and recommended a few places to find souvenirs and other brews since i am not from north carolina.  the corn was very juicy and buttery. boyfriend got the beer there and he loved it.","as strange as it may sound, we come here for the rosemary tater tots. do not get me wrong, the beer is solid, too. it is, after all, a brewery. but the tater tots are crave-inducing!","although i am not a big craft beer drinker heist has a really cool atmosphere-tvs, outdoor seating, and creative food presentations that are good to share!  great addition to noda!","dang! i was gonna fight jared for the first reviewer badge, but we were both beaten. finally, heist is open! the amount of work that has gone into each part of the brewery is unimaginable (to me anyway, who knows nothing about wood or granite work). the space itself is huge and well thought out. there is a bar in the front and another in the back. they serve not just their own beer, but also liquor for those unfortunate gluten free souls. their menu is pretty great as well, not typical bar food at all. it was opening night, so i will have to forgive them for not having pretzel sticks for my beer cheese (which was delicious). i heard great things about the chicken and waffles, the bacon wrapped tots, and flat bread. the presentation and aroma of all the dishes that passed by me were impressive. they served the bacon wrapped tots on small slabs of granite and the flat bread on custom carved wood platters. most importantly, the beer. i loved the iMeaning to in Short Message Servicepa - hoppy, complex goodness. and the second beer i had was damn good too...i ordered a red, but i swear it was a pale ale because my friend ordered the pale ale and got something that tasted like a red. so, i won out on that (probably) order mistake. in any case, i will have to come back to be sure. they will have brunch offerings in a few weeks so i will just have to be here all hours of theo, they played some tracks from my favorite band which i have not heard played at any other establishment (besides a concert venue). big props for good tunes.","heist did not win me and my friends over. great location, very welcoming interior, but that is where the excitement stopped for us. we felt the food could have been much better and the specialty cocktails were decent. the hostess was great but our server was not the best. with so many great bars in the noda area i am not sure i would be willing to return.","cool, modern style brewery with a nice restaurant/tasting room.  heist is definitely set up to cater to the sports bar/hipster crowd, complete with tons of sports on the tvs, plenty of beer, and light menut here with the kids and ordered the pretzels (meh), the lamb meatballs (which were a bit spicy, cooked perfectly, and generally pretty dang good) and the duck flatbread (pretty good, would have liked the bbq sauce to be a bit less overbearing).overall the atmosphere speaks volumes, it is a cool place.  the beer is supposed to be main attraction, but it can get lost in the shuffle.  do not let it, however - it is delicious!","food was amazing! good, casual, good-for-groups atmosphere. come here with your friends if you want to shout the whole time at them. do not come here for a date or any occasion where you want to have a conversation. the plus side is that because the place is so loud all around, no one else can hear your conversation either. it is got a high-end sports bar atmosphere, which i love, but it just might need a few more screens. the beers are pretty darn tasty. we got some fancy wings, fries, and a flatbread to share. everything was really good. i only wish we would brought more people and money so that we could have tried more on the menu. i ca not tell you how many times we eyed the dishes that were being served to our neighbors. it is a bit on the pricey side considering it is still got that sports bar vibe, but if you are any sort of foodie, you will likee: the bartender does not seem to know how to make a moscow mule or any variation of. i got something with really flat too-sweet ginger beer, and not enough lime. sad face. so, protip: stick to beer.","def has a traditional german hall feelwe each got flights, and let me just say i really wanted to like this placethe only one i really liked was the red alei found the hefeweizen flat/minerally and off tasting---perhaps its the water they use? there was no clove or banana esters at all, very disappointingwheats and belgians are my favorite so i really thought i would enjoy their beers but alas they were not ---the saving grace was the delicious, freshly baked (slightly over salted) pretzelseems like they have a rotating selection so maybe there will be more good beers from them, i love the concept of the idea/ambience/aesthetics i just wish the beers mirrored that ideal","first time i have been to heist brunch, they apparently just reworked the menu.  the brunch buffet is a colossal amount of food and in a thinly veiled attempt to kill their patrons you are offered an  la carte item as well.  so in addition to buffet items like the waffle, grits, biscuits, roast, flatbread pizza, potatoes (all excellent) and eggs, sausages, bacon (all pretty meh) we ordered the leaf eater omelet and the hash brown.  i make omelets everyday like a machine that runs on eggs and butter and usually restaurant omelets are a watery, over cooked mess.  this omelet was on point with tomatoes that actually tasted like tomatoes (unfortunately seems to be more and more rare).  the hash browns  were also good.so even though some of the buffet proteins were kinda gross (and really i do not think i have had buffet bacon or sausage that were good) i have to give props to heist for their brunch.  a++++ would eat all my days calories in one sitting again.","good beer, better food! great food menu with great variety of options! this is definitely not your normal pub grub! pork belly corn dogs were a delicious spin on a great classic! beers are good but noda and birdsong give them a better run for their money as best breweries in clt!","awful. just awful. party of six, three of us ordered the succession beer. flat, no head and it smelled like a frat house on a sunday morning. just bad beer. the waiter said \"yes, it is flat. it is for people who want bud light\". for crying out loud, it is a craft brewery. if someone wants something like bud light they should go elsewhere. i ordered the grilled cheese and it gave me a sour stomach. clearly, people are only going here because they think it is trendy.","atmosphere and service are great. beer is very good. food is amazing. the beer cheese and duck flatbread are incredible and the chicken and waffle sushi is differ t and tasty.","great food.","great location, food was comfortable, though not a large selection. being a buffet, i was underwhelmed by the array of food. service was standard, no bells and whistles. an all around comfortable spot for brunch.","crazy sexy cool.  visited heist after a concert at the close by neighborhood theatre and had a smattering of their shared plates and beer sampling among a group of four of us.  their sample is great!  you can get five beers of your choice for $6, and for someone like me, that is plenty enough!  i am girly when it comes to drinks so i enjoy the more fruity than hoppy or dark beers so their raspberry porter and strawberry blonde varieties were right up my alley.  the server gave us the awesome suggestion to mix the two, yum!their tapas style food was perfect for picking at and eating while chatting with friends.  their waffles & chicken sushi was delish!  the service was really great and we were able to get seats quickly and attentively on a saturday night.  we will definitely be back!","cool place liked the drinks loved the flatbreads. i am not a local, never heard of this place but wanted to try some new things. we told the bar tender what we liked porters/stouts for me wheat for aubs and we let him order flights for us. the ruckus imperial stout was delicious, if i lived in the area i would have gotten a growler. they had a limited quantity maple beer which we both liked, it was aubs is fav tasted like a breakfast beer if there is such a thing, we also enjoyed the out to pasture. the grand optimist and succession were decent. the bar tender picked well for ourer seeing the flatbreads come out of the oven by the entrance we were compelled to give it a try. the bar tender confirmed that the bbq duck flatbread and chicken waffle flatbread were great choices. again he was right. they make their own root beer in house which is then used to make the bbq sauce. the duck was lean, the flatbread was flavorful. the chicken and waffle flatbread had large cubes of chicken and bite sized pieces of waffle all covered in maple syrup. aubs liked the sweeter chicken/waffle better, i preferred the savory bbq duck.my advice is to sit at the bar, tell them what you like and let them order for you. sometimes it is nice to be babied at the brewery.","been twice now.  once for brunch and the other time dinner.  we been lucky with our timing cause the place gets packed.  tried the san diego beer and the uzl ... very nice. i think this will be a spot to revisit again!","having had lived in portland, or for most of my adult life, i have to say, this is some of the most adventurous and tasty brewing i have come across. nw ipa is are my all-time favorite beers, and their dzl was hoppy, balanced, and delicious. their pistolo, an amber ale brewed with habanero, was neither too spicy nor too cloying, like some infused beers can be. it was balanced and delicious. so delicious. and now let me start on the food. we had the shrimp and bleu cheese grits, freaking fabulous and balanced,  the brussel sprouts in the bubble (i do not remember the exact name) was beyond amazing, and the faux-b-q eggplant tacos were super yummy. after the fabulous drink and food, you add in the service and this place is a must stop for anybody living in, visiting, or within driving distance. nick walker, the bartender, and curt (kurt?), the owner actually engaged in great conversation with us and others there. we will be back. tomorrow, actually. and if i ever visit here again, you can bet your ass i will be in one of there seats. i think you should be, too. if you like craft beer and twisted eats, that is.","beautiful space, awesome staff. i come here for the duck quesadilla, beer cheese, and of course, stefan is phenomenal cocktails.","heist maaaaaay have just knocked toast down to my second favorite brunch spot. went last weekend for their sunday brunch ($15 all you can eat), and it was amazing. they had a great variety of food available (not just run-of-the-mill breakfast items), set up buffet style. sometimes when i am hungry and hungover, the act of choosing/ordering is overwhelming- enter heist. genius! the only downside...word is out so you will have a wait but its totally worth it!oh and i love their dinner menu/vibe as

good.  wish they had fresh squeezed oj cause the concentrate that they have (but put in their own cups) is not so good.","great food, helpful staff, nice location.","early morning - got an order of spinach, egg, with mushroom on plain bagel.  i wish the egg was salted.  i loved everything in it but there was not much flavor.  decent breakfast, nonetheless.","i agree with joy: einstein bros is better and, as a result, more crowded than bruegger is, with good reason: they have better bagels and better coffee. indeed, if it is a light breakfast i am after, i am coming to this einstein bros, which is both conveniently located on south, right near uptown. if you are looking for lunch, definitely head to bruegger is or nearby sub station. if, however, you are looking for an even better bagel option (in terms of sandwiches), continue down south to owen is. you will love it. this particular einstein is is really clean and pretty well-run, even when it is crowded, so you are never too unhappy waiting in line. and like i said earlier, the coffee is well worth it.","horrible, horrible customer service. i called to place an order for the next day and the guy hung up. called back, and he asked me if i was joking. seriously? i just wanted some bagels! anywho, went in to get a sandwich a few weeks later, and the onion bagel was toasted to the point of being burnt (could not get the taste out of my mouth for hours!). i ended up throwing it away after Meaning to in Short Message Service bites. the manager asked me why i would waste it, not even ask if something was wrong. not a big fan of their veggie  ishmear, it is pretty bland.","bagels are great but unfortunately it is easily the worst coffee i have had in months -- and i got coffee from a gas station recently...","c amon man. ordered a toasted bagel at he drive thru.....given a not toasted bagel. i promise i will survive, but how much effort does it take to fill a simple order?????","einstein is bagels are pretty poor in general, so perhaps its unfair to rate this particular location so lowly, you say? not so fast...found myself killing time between meetings here Meaning to in Short Message Service years ago, and ordered the bagel that made me famous in some out of the way places -- everything bagel, butter, tomato.  that is it. a simple order, provided the tomatoes are not green, under-ripe and miserable, which they have been at this location often. so i ask, \"hey, i would like this creepy bagel order i get everytime i am here, but not if the tomatoes are miserable and white/green. can you please check, and if they are, please do not serve them to me. despite how they are universally beloved, i do not particularly like white, veiny, hard tomatoes.\"she acknowledged my request, and when i was handed my bagel, i figured it meant that they were ripe. not only were not they, they were almost pure white winter tomatoes and sliced extra thick. i mean... really?this might seem like a small thing, but i asked, and i was served the exact thing i requested to not be served. i have not been back since, and i spit twice when i pass it.i take bagels (way too) seriously...","charlotte has a real lack of bagel shops.  those we do have are primarily chains.  lucky for us, though einstein is a chain, they have got the bagel thing nailed and their location isht on the edge between dilworth and south end, this small shop has a mix of outdoor tables and indoor seating options- bar, big table, little table, etc.  the front counter is filled with the day is bagel selections and the folks behind are busily making sandwiches and filling other orders.  do not see the bagel you want?  make sure you ask, because they are usually baking in the back and can tell you how long it will be till the next piping hot batch comes out.  the ordering system has recently been greatly improved here.  order at one end of the counter and then pick up and pay at the other end.  no more trying to decipher your order form a hand written ticket or having you repeat to the cashier what you have- it is all electronic now, and that seems to speed things along.my wife really likes the bagel bites here- a cup filled with little bagel holes, usually with a flavor.  cinnamon sugar seems to be the favorite.  they also had pumpkin for thing i am not a fan for are the bagel thin sandwiches- i just find the actual bagel thin to be just as thin on taste and flavor.  guess i just need that chewy carby goodness to satisfy?  i am a fan of their coffees, though.  they do have a full espresso station, but i really like their coffee blends- especially the fall harvest blend.  they keep timers on top so no pot sits longer than a hour, that makes sure your cup is fresh- nice touch.  my only gripe with drinks is the woefully small beverage station.  coffee mixers, tops, and the soda machine all share the counter-space.  the result is no more than 1 person at a time can really be there- get is crowded too easily and the last thing you want is your hot coffee sloshing around in your hands as you make way for others to squeeze in.  despite this, i ca not deny the goodness that is an einstein bagel with schmear- or a bagel breakfast sandwich with a cup of great coffee to match.  quick and easy on the weekdays, with plenty of room for longer stays on the weekend.  i say- on the whole- well done!","great location and very good coffee with free refills.  i have had the asparagus, mushroom, egg white, and swiss bagel and its very good.  the bagel with a large coffee is $7+ and if you are like me you will still be hungry as the bagel is a little on the small side :(, that is my only complaint!","bagels are fine and staff is nice enough. however, the store itself is disgusting. no matter the time of day everything is grimy...the floors, the coffee area, the soda machine. no way they clean daily, there is years of accumulated dirt on the floor is perimeter, the walls, etc.  the structure itself, the bathroom, etc. is seriously run down looking. they are located in prime real estate in dilworth, they can afford a deep cleaning and then a daily maintenance scrub.it is walking distance to the house but i rarely go because the lack of cleanliness is a turn off. if it is that bad in the front of house i can only imagine what lack of standards there are in the back of house. clearly management does not take pride in theirappointing.","first time at this location 8/10/15.  i was not greeted when i walked in the store.   stood the for Short for for in Short Message Service

coffee and a bagel to nosh on when you get to work. i stick to my favorite order: chai latter and toasted plain bagel with veggie cream cheese. there is often a line on weekday mornings, but they are pretty fast there.","decided to give this place a try for breakfast since its right around the corner from my job and i was a bit early. this place is busy! be prepared for a wait, especially in drive

it was surprisingly good. i asked for jelly but ended up eating it plain. my only complaints are the onions were really raw & thick. i took most of them off and cut the ones left a bit more, this helped. also, i think he was the manager but maybe not, he seemed to lead a lot of the kitchen, but his pants were hanging off his booty! i thought that was a big much, distracting and unprofessional. also they charge you fifty cents for a pack of jelly and they are not consistent about it. the first time i went it was just given to me, this last time is when i was informed of the cost.","good bagels, good service, great location, coffee average, wait - not longgood place if you are craving for a bagel or bagel sandwich","great stop for morning coffee andy access to parking. i like the

side salmon, sliced it to the thickness i needed, wrapped it up and i was out the door in five minutes. this goes to show, and proves to anyone who doubts, that they have the freshest, highest quality, never frozen fish on a regular basis. i personally watched this beautiful piece of wild caught salmon come directly in the door in a non-frozen state and be cut for me specifically to order.

my kind of beers! problem was that we got there late, so they were kinda putting the bar to rest. however, the folks behind the bar were really super and friendly and offered to pour a few more past closing. that was a very nice gesture, but we did not take them up on it as we respected that they too wanted to clean up and go home. ok, i am totally off on a tangent now....grrrrrr. back to the beers. i did get to sample Meaning to in Short Message Service of them: mine and one from my young friends. so i got the belgian dubbel, which was 7.6% abv. very good....i also tried a biere de garde, like a lager. but what i really want to try is this magical concoction called sugar creek xv, which is a whopping 15% abv! 15% people! that is like stronger than most wines! i know it is limited but i have got to be there when they brew it....it just sounds friggen amazing! a long time ago in a tavern far, far away, i did try an 18% beer which was a very special reserve beer from sam adams. sweet and unlike i have ever had before. i wonder if this would be simliar? who knows. i have just got to have this!so my first impression was a very good one, and i look forward to going back to try all

about 8pm on a chilly saturday night to find a tasting room that was very uniquely decorated. you would never know just driving down this industrial street that such a cool/funky place was nestled in here. the decor is funky, yet classy...the brewing facility you can see thru the large wall height windows is itself one of the cleanest i have every seen, the copper and chrome look really is cool. the beers themselves were classic in offerings, ranging from a wheat, to a pale ale, an ipa and a dark dubbel as i recall. all were great tasting and i would drink them again for sure. i did notice that the tasting room very quickly filled up, but the staff did a great to keep pace, and even got us our souvenir hat and shirt in a quickat job to sugar creek as a whole... keep it up! looking forward to seeing your brews out here on the west coast soon!","great atmosphere and beers! their seasonal beers right now are amazing. very rich in flavor.","i am actually a bigger fan of the space

 i mean we are all sweating all over the place and it gets soaked through and you are eventually walking in a puddle of someone elses sweat - which kinda grosses me out...but let is face it bikram is a sweaty gross mess!i have been to a few studios in chicago that did not have carpet and i preferred them b/c at least you could see the puddle and jump over it.  i also felt that when there was no carpet the studio smelled less.  but as far as bikram goes, this place has got it down.  there is not much you can mess up since there are Meaning to in Short Message Service6 specific poses.  the teacher was very friendly when i have been there, and at times (weekends) it can get a bit crowded.  i do not rent their mat or towels b/c i bring my own, but do not forget to bring lots ofo when i was there some of the clientele are not really familar with bikram manners - like do not just get up and walk around closer to the window for some air and walk out of the studio b/c you ran out of water.  i mean there are exeptions like if you feel like your about to faint, but they tell you that the goal is to stay in the room and not to disturb those around you.  not sure that pittsburgh is ready for bikram so maybe it makes sense that there is only 1 studio for now.","each instructor brings something different to the class, every day! class times are convenient, so regardless of your work schedule, you can make it to a class.","disgusting. would give zero stars if i could. place was dirty. carpeted floors in a hot yoga setting is a terrible idea. imagine sweaty, damp carpeted floors teeming with bacteria that is flourishing in the humid, tropical temps. smelled like urine, b.o., and mold. the smell was so overpowering that it actually made me nauseous. i have done hot yoga/bikhram at many studios for years, and i was unable to complete even one class at this site because of the foulness. packed in one hot little dark room like sardines with barely an inch between mats. not nearly enough room to comfortably and serenely hold poses. teachers were condescending and arrogant. yoga is supposed to be about your own practice, and what feels right for your own body. teachers were very authoritarian about when we were \"allowed\" to take sips of water (hot yoga. dehydration. need water. hello!?) and how we were \"allowed\" to rest between poses. no child is pose \"allowed\" apparently. will never return to this place and will actively encourage friends not to go. purchased this on groupon and demanded my money back for both my friend and myself. stay away.","great yoga studio in a beautiful space.  big, clean, hard wood floors, mirrored walls.  bathroom with showers and lockers (also clean).  instructors are helpful, friendly (they remember your name), not pushy and pay individualized attention to you in a way that is not over-bearing.  they should have a solid Short for for in Short Message Service-star rating for sure. i have done bikram in several different cities from brooklyn to san francisco and in between and this is a great studio.  my one recommendation would be to offer classes that vary (in terms of level/poses/length).  but if you want a solid hour and a half class of bikram-i would highly recommend this spot.","come hydrated and ready to sweat! awesome class!","before i get some response telling me that i do not understand bikram yoga and i should do more research, i will tell you that i do know what bikram yoga is and i have done my research. there *is* more than one bikram studio in the city so there is a way to compare. i do not want to start some yoga war, but i find the atmosphere of this studio not very welcoming. there seems to be no allowance for any modifications if you ca not get the pose. other bikram studios i have been to want you to try for the pose, but will help you get there if you ca not. i have given this studio two separate trial periods at different times, but it is really not for me. and they do have an issue with regulating the heat. i find as soon as the windows are open, any kind of heat regulations goes out the window...***just a response to zeb, i do not feel like i have been cooked at any other bikram studio. they just keep the temp and humidity constant, which i appreciate. opening a window does not give you precise temperature i actually tried this studio multiple times both under the old ownership and the new ownership. i went in with an open mind and a positive attitude, bec. i love all types of yoga. but having the owner of the studio glaring at you on the sidewalk outside, as you walk in, does not give a good impression. and no, it was not just in my mind and i am actually not being overly sensitive and yes, it was obvious i was going to do yoga and i did try to smile at her bec. i recognized her from the website.","after moving back to pittsburgh this past spring, this is now my regular yoga studio (woohoo!). i decided i needed to update my review because they just moved to a new location (right where penn and butler meet - on penn, just across from the statue).since i implied in my last review that the old studio itself was not as big/ fancy as my studio in berkeley (though it was great in other ways), i feel like i now need to say: the new studio is big and fancy (in an cool industrial way) and brand spankin new! (three showers in each locker room and much more mirror in the studio.) so, not only are the classes still great, the teachers still caring, and the students still diverse... the space is now equally awesome. also, parking is a lot easier in the new spot and apparently bike racks will be up shortly. so happy to see this great business growing!","fabulous studio! from the day i stepped foot in bikram yoga pittsburgh i have never felt more invited. all of the instructors are amazing. they are so passionate about their practice and take time to know every single students name. they also provide demos when necessary as they want to be sure each student gets the most out of every class. the energy in the studio is electrifying. the studio owner zeb is a yoga world champion and so inspiring to watch, it is an honor taking one of his classes. the studio is superb, always as clean as a whistle with the most friendly, inviting staff. i ca not recommend this studio enough to my family and friends. pittsburgh is best juice bar is also located right next store, owned by zeb as well. another added bonus to joining the community at bikram yoga pittsburgh!","bikram yoga is heat yoga in a carpet studio. the studio smells like an old gym sock. i wanted to wear shower shoes just to cross the room. ick!","great studio!!

convenient, taking the trip to mt. washington (olympia) is a better idea. it is about three to four times the size and kept in much better condition. anytime it rains, the south side park is a mess. there is mud all over the place and it gets pretty gross. not to mention having to put a messy dog in your car is never a fun thing to do. they also could do some more maintenance here and there. the

impressed at how pretty the city actually was. in fact, it reminded me a lot of my hometown of cincinnati with all the bridges and water. hearing good things about point state park, we decided to check it out, hoping to get some good views of them what we saw, the park seemed like a pretty nice green space, with areas for hanging out and paths for bike riding, running, or walking. unfortunately, the actual point of the park with the fountain was closed for what looked like some sort of construction. it may have also been because of the season, considering we visited in january. although the park is not big by any means big, it is still worth checking out if you are staying in the downtown area, or just have some time to kill. hopefully on my next visit the point will actually be open to the public. it would be pretty cool to stand on the very point where the two different rivers connect to form the ohio!","during a recent weekend, i was drawn to point state park for the same reason as the hordes of tourists who found themselves here - the four-story tall rubber duck art installation. the duck was such as important item on our itinerary that we came here on two consecutive days, first day shortly after landing and the next night after a dinner downtown. if you are arriving the park the first time by car like me, i would strongly suggest you find parking a few blocks away and then walk over. that is because a wrong turn could easily take you across either of the two rivers (which actually happened to me). the park was quite clean and well-kept; it seemed recently renovated. you get gorgeous river views as well as views of mt. washington on the south side and heinz stadium on the north side. the fountain was just as lively as advertised. maybe it was the extra security that was in placed with the rubber duck in town, but visiting the park after 10 pm felt surprisingly safe. families and couples were still flocking there after dark.","great park for a date!!!come here at night and during the day, the fountain is beautiful.  there is a public bathroom and it ist a great place to relax and enjoy the pittsburgh waterfront views of the bridges, heinz field fountain closes at like 11pm so come before that time or you will miss it.","a great spot at the historic point of pittsburgh. you can see the outline of the historic french fort that was here, watch an absolutely massive water mountain and refresh yourself in surprisingly nice public washrooms. great place on a summer afternoon.","beautiful view of the sunset at three rivers. i take my daughter for a walk daily at the park, too bad there are no children activities here but we still love the view.","bring the fountain back!! it is taken away the most beautiful part of the park! it is funny to me because i always see pictures with the fountain in it and....wah wah...it is not even working! they remodeled the whole park and just opened it back up last summer.  i remember before they remodeled, concerts used to be inside the park instead of on the outside corner. rumor has it they did not want hundreds of people trampling on the lawn. but, is not that kinda sorta what a park is about? i think it is great they repaved the trail around the park because it had been falling apart. and pardon me for being anti-preservationist, but i am glad they took the ditch (ditch being some sort of fort from back in the day) out of the front of the park. i ca not imagine how many people accidentally fell in. i will say the good things are the three rivers arts festival  and regatta held there. yay for the chicken on a stick booth! good things number two is the concerts during the summer, even if i do not like the location. and most importantly good things number three is that we have a park in the city! i would not call it the central park of pittsburgh (that is more reserved for schenley park) but it is a nice little back. but bring back the fountain!"]},"Crossfit

on the national register. awesome old-timey wooden coasters as well as those new fangled tubular steel coasters. the racer and phantom is revenge are my favorites. both old and new. they both have their charms. well maintained. it is not disneyland, but that just adds to the charm. i love the various signs and pictures discussing the history of the place. food? it is batter dipped, it deep

perfect example of how to blend out and new together in perfect harmony. awesome classic wooden coasters mixed with modern and exciting thrill rides. probably also one of the best values as far as amuesment parks go in the country. there are a few knocks on this park though:~ food options are not that great... i find potato patch revolting and that is the main food dry of the park. ~ lack of good steel coasters. do not get me wrong phantom is revenge is good, but not as good as the original phantom. i think they should have both because it would have been a nice compliment. my solution to the food is either a quick walk outside the park to the mcdonalds for cheap eats or the cafeteria that is pretty hidden but it is decent.","always been a fan of taking my Meaning to in Short Message

better.  the lights are very nice, potato patch always good and the funnel cakes a+! the negative is the huge under staffing.  lines are extremely long everywhere if it is a nice night.  opening night was a disaster getting in because they had very little staff.   they need to staff accordingly when the weather is nice.  we will continue to go, especially since it is included in the ride and slide season pass.","as lifelong pittsburgher, kennywood is one of those places that i feel like i know very well. it had been a few years since my last visit, so i was excited to see that they continue to make improvements to the park and add new rides. the new rollercoaster at the front of the park called the sky rocket was so much fun we road it again before we left the park. i love how kennywood has a great balance of new and old. there is so much history in kennywood and its nice to see it preserved while they also continue to advance their park into the future with new rides and attractions. also, as i am sure many many people have said before me, you ca not go wrong with a order of cheesy bacon covered potato patch fries! if you go to kennywood and do not eat potato patch, you are nuts!","had a ton of fun...the sky rocket is probably one of the smoothest coasters i have ever been on. the park has a lot of attractions to keep you busy. no disney but worth a trip every couple years or so.","having grown up going to kennywood may make my review nostalgic and perhaps a tad biased. it rarely has the latest rides, and a new coaster, while the annual norm at cedar point, is cause for disbelief and upheaval here. that said, i love going here with friends and family. the park has an old world charm to it. there are trees and green areas. live acts on the grounds. just a ton of things to do and see. the thunderbolt is still one of the great classic wooden coasters. it is not up to the standards of the new wood coasters, but again. it is timeless design makes it fun to this day. the great part being the rarity of starting the ride by going directly into the first drop rather than being pulled up the first hill. the phantom is revenge is still one of my favorite metal coasters. not so new either, but the oddity of the biggest drop being the Meaning to in Short Message Servicend is still a great draw. also, some new favorites like the sky rocket, which i would compare to the maverick at cedar point, but much shorter (both in duration and line), and my new personal favorite, the black widow. given my fear of spiders i hate the entry, but the ride is just amazing. also, the crown jewel of kennywood though is the potato patch fries. simply the best fries absolutely anywhere. if i am just looking for out and out thrill rides, sure, i love cedar point, but for a close and fun day with friends and family, i still love kennywood.","\"you will love kennywood!\"  \"it is such an amazing place!\"  \"one of the best amusement parks you will ever go to\"  \"filled with history!\"with such glowing comments from people who knew i was going to kennywood, i figured how could i not love this place?!  although it left me worried that if i did not love it, i would be disowned by my pittsburgh friends and family.i think a large part of the allure of kennywood is how nostalgic it makes people feel.  every person who has talked about it has fond memories from their childhood or hs.  and this ranges from people age 6 to age Parent is watching6.  and that is pretty awesome.  i enjoyed my day at kennywood.  it is size is managable for a day of fun and it packs a lot of adventure in a somewhat small area.  i love that there is something for everyone.  thrill seekers have great coasters.  families have kiddie land and those that prefer the tame have the garfield boat ride, the noah is ark and the whip.  make sure you bring your appetite!  the food is above average compared to most other parks.  of course, there is the famous potato patch, but do not miss out on hand battered corn dogs, hand dipped ice cream cones and hot and tasty funnel cakes!  just make sure you have already taken a spin on the adventure rides.","a great old theme park with a carnival feel. it has good rides, we love the potato patch fries, cotton candy and funnel cake! the new rides they have added are pretty sweet and more modern. they have a new sky coaster as well as the black widow which i was almost too terrified to get on. as you enter the park, they play that old timey music that sounds like your on a carrousel. you enter into this tunnel and when you come out on the other side it is kennywood. that exciting feeling of all the memories you had as a kid growing up and going here for school picnics. i am afraid of heights but i always love to get on rides that take you up high..except the pit fall, i never really enjoyed that ride. that is probably why they too it down. but they replaced it with the black widow which may have become my new favorite ride at kennywood. it is similar to the sling shot but twice as high and it slowly spins around. before getting on this ride i was soooo terrified. i thought i was gonna scream my lungs out but the ride looks scarier from the ground than it does up in the air. it almost feels like your riding a bike down a very steep hill or like skydiving! all the wind and the fact that you get so high all you can see is the sky and nothing else is absolutely amazing. it feels like your being launched to they have plenty of fun games for you to play and an arcade for younger kids. i always see someone walking around with one of those big rasta bananas...:d my favorite rides are the log jammer, all the coasters, swing shot, turtle, noah is ark, pirate ship and the black widow. i would like to include the exterminator but that ride can be brutal if you ride with a partner. the steel side bars press into your arm as your partner is slammed into you, i ended up with a bruise on my arm. other than the great rides and picnic area for family get togethers, i must say that the food is pretty amazing. the fries as you know is the best part of the whole park, that and the funnel cake  with strawberry and ice cream on top. i love it sooo much and we try to get it every time. if anyone is looking for a great family outing with plenty of ride for the babies and the grade schoolers, this is the place to go. my niece loves the baron curve which i think is a little too fast for a 6 year old but hell if she likes it so do i."]},"Gold's Gym":{"name":"Gold's

you know there will eventually be someone passing by if you get into trouble, but you can also go for miles without seeing anyone which is nice sometimes. i have always felt safe riding on this trail which is important for a solo female rider. there are frequent bathrooms and water sources (not all water pumps provide potable water so bring some sort of purification mechanism if you are embarking on a multi-day ride). there are towns all along the trail which means options for diner meals, grocery stores, bike shops and a few cute little tourist attractions. most of the trail is crushed gravel which means a little tread will be an advantage. any bike is really going to work just fine. i ride a cyclocross with 700c tires and am perfectly comfortable riding this trail. some parts can get really muddy and in those circumstances i envy the mountain bikers. this trail is great for short day rides or multi-day excursions and pittsburgher is are lucky to have such easy access to such a

even though the only areas this is allowed are the dog parks.  this is dangerous for those who ride bikes in the park, people who are afraid of dogs, and unfortunately as i found out, those who have dogs that are agressive with other dogs.  even though my dog was on a leash, i had a few harried moments when an unleashed dog ran up to my dog.  i resorted to muzzling my dog when walking him through frick and then it was like i was walking hannibal lector through the park you should have seen the looks i got--but you know what, i didnt care, it was the only way my dog and i could both enjoy thet

need then for $10 this place is a steal..  it is clean. probably the cleanest in the area.  the music is not to loud.  when i got at 5am it is usually empty.it is the only gym in the area that is open

appeared older and a bit rundown. and all of the animals were in such small cages. they all looked bored or sad or something. i am definitely no peta lover here, but it just seemed kind of cruel to have these large animals (like the snow leopard) in tiny cages. the monkeys were all indoors and it was hot and smelly in there. the orangutan exhibit looked like it did not have any grass or plants in it (at least from what i saw) and once again, was so tiny for such a large monkey. also, there did not seem to be a lot of places to grab food - i saw one dippin dots kiosk and one restaurant. i am sure there is more that i missed, but it certainly was not a hopping place food wise. the only thing i sort of enjoyed was the aquarium. it appeared newer, but even so, there is only so many fish i

the large acreage many of the stalls seem very small with sad animals in them. but even then, there are lots of places to view the animals (and this was on a sunday with lots of kids around). i will

going to hotels so i do not blame them.  our floor was on the 8th floor looking out to the point with a perfect view of the fountain.  when it gets to be a bit darker, there is a spotlight that shines

crowded with two people trying to get ready in the mornings.  the bathroom door is also partially see through from the glass panes.  our floor, for the most part was generally quiet.  you can hear peoples conversations from the next door over and the maids walking by, which is pretty common in most hotels.  room service for breakfast was pretty good.  egg white vegetable frittata, belgian waffle with fresh berries, and a small pot of coffee was ordered.  they only gave us one coffee cup and forgot the toast for the egg dish.  i would definitely go to a different hotel the next time i

(fairly extensive) breakfast menu if you want something else. the dining room is beautiful, and there are plenty of newspapers to keep you company if you are diningrall, i enjoyed my stay at mansions on fifth. my coworker and i felt very well taken care of, and i am pretty sure we had the whole second building to ourselves (we were there in late february, which i do not imagine is high season), so we were able to camp out in the comfortable living room and work / chat without worrying about bothering anyone else.","excellent place to call home in pittsburgh.  compared to most corporate and pricey hotels in the city, this small hotel has a lot of charm and character going for it.  the staff were extremely nice and helpful; owners are faithfully restoring this historic mansion, piece by

gathered in the evening, a library  where multiple morning papers awaited, the front parlor  where we opened christmas gifts, a dining room that was the ultimate in elegance and the lobby where there was a huge christmas tree, a piano  and an inglenook with fireplace. the staff went out of their way to be  friendly and helpful ( mind you, they were working on their holiday too). they helped us with transportation and gave advice about area restaurants and churches. there were so many christmasy things to do in the surrounding university part of the city: displays at carnegie museum, phipps

(one lot across the street, another around the block), including one lot that is only accessible to hotel guests.  the other lot is posted to only permit hotel guests to park there but there did not appear to be a way to monitor this, although it is possible (likely?) hotel staff does so.  in addition to the friendliness of the staff and shuttle service to the stadium, the continental breakfast

$Meaning to in Short Message Service0/day for parking.  for $150/night, i could see the parador inn was close to downtown (near the stadiums, just across allegheny), parking was free, breakfast included, and i would booked what amounted to two private sleeping rooms under the guise of one room (the bougainvillea) at the same rate - which was important as i wanted to be removed from my snoring father.on check-in, i was even more impressed.  the house is vast and amazing, a true old mansion.  ed has brought a caribbean touch to this victorian home with a subtle hand.  it is not kitchy, gaudy, hokey, or tacky.  it is elegant and adds a comfortable, breezy feel to what could easily be a stuffy old mansion.  you will want to take pictures of the whole property, i promise.  and look up!  the ceilings in the common rooms are fascinating, and i did not even notice them till the third night.  ed himself was the perfect proprietor.  helpful, knowledgeable, friendly, but also efficient.  available, but not particularly chatty.  he is also a great cook, and we had three diverse and interesting breakfasts across three mornings.  again, the perfect balance.  this is not scrambled eggs and toast, but unique and very satisfying dishes, all meats on the side (vegetarian friendly!), accompanied by a yogurt parfait (which my father in particular loved each day) and different fresh baked sweet bread each morning.  the last happy surprise was just how convenient the parador inn is.  it is located in a great neighborhood - not exactly a bustling, trendy hub, but a quiet old victorian district with several chic modern restaurants just a block or two away (with fast food chains as close in the opposite direction if you are on a quickie budget).  you can easily wind down the last few hours of an exhausting day of pittsburgh sightseeing by strolling around this area before crashing in your room.  the inn is literally three short blocks from the highway, could not be easier to find on your first day.  and for access to downtown, it is a five minute walk to the light rail, and in the free fare zone, so you can go back and forth from downtown in minutes for no charge.  in fact, pittsburgh is so walkable and safe, one night after dark we were at point state park downtown and we walked across the bridge back to the hotel - Meaning to in Short Message

windows, beautiful hardwood floors, fireplaces in virtually every room, and lavish furnishings with a caribbean touch. every room has its own story and style and really is total eye candy for anyone who is an antique & nostalgia lover like myself. if you are a murano glass enthusiast be sure to check out the stellar chandelier in the main living space to the left of the front entrance - it is a sight to be seen. this room also contains the mansions only remaining original fireplace mantle which is a work of art. ask ed about how it came to remain on the property, it is a funny little story. speaking of ed, our host & owner of the mansion, was extremely knowledgable about the property and surrounding area. i of course had a million questions about both which he happily answered for me.

in our apartment and came equipped with delicious smelling soaps, shampoo, conditioner, and even makeup removing wipes - it is the little things, right ladies!?breakfast is served several times in the

the walls are dark and decorated with wood and stained glass. the furniture is elegant but not stuffy, and the bar was obviously once a den or a library that was converted. the bar is rather small, housing four Meaning to in Short Message Service-seat tables, a Short for for in Short Message Service-top, and about 8 spaces at the bar. behind the bar, light shines through a small collection of liquor bottles. the top of the bar and tables are inlaid with tile patterns and candles are spread throughout.i browsed the martini menu, not finding much that would suit my palate as it all sounded sweeter, or too far from a martini(tequila, cointreau, and orange juice is closer to a margarita than a martini - and that jose cuervo on your top shelf does not send a good impression of your margarita). i stuck with the classic, then, and ordered a basic dry gin martini without garnish. it was made quickly and without love, shaking instead of stirring, and putting it in an un-chilled glass. not that there was much to love, while the bottles on the shelf could be called mid-range, the bottles used for my drink and for others were right out of the bottom of the barrel. banker is club is the gin of choice here, and burnett is flavored vodka is the base of most of the drinks on their menu. the martini came(not filled to the top, seems they measure precisely to include garnish), strong with little vermouth, but given the alcohol, devoid of any flavor but ethanol and a hint of citrus.i found as i drank that food is no longer available at all in the hotel as they no longer served as a restaurant, even though signage was still in place throughout the building. i quietly finished my drink and closed my tab. how much did my room temperature banker is club cost? a cool $Parent is watching.it appears that somewhere between the last two years and now, this hotel must have come upon hard times or new management. if you are staying at the hotel and need a drink, hop a

for parties (or when you really just want a giant shrimp cocktail for yourself), and miscellaneous items-- like great deals on socks and prilosec.  at other stores, i have had good luck buying bigger items like electronics, and i have gotten some furniture from costco online.  and of course, you ca not complain about paying $1.50 for a hot dog and drink.i do not suggest going right at closing--

that they have samples of things, because of course, who wants a years supply of something that is not their fave. the gasoline alone is worth the price of admission. take advantage of their optical

stores. coming from san francisco and d.c., this is a form of torture! the first time my husband and i went here we got a huge container of salad, oranges, grapes, and a big bag of potatoes (and several other things but that is not important). within two days the salad was soggy and there was a layer of brown liquid at the bottom of the container. there was this huge spider web thing at the bottom of the grapes... that totally freaked me out! the oranges had mold growing out of it in a matter of days. to top off the grossness (yes, i made that up) the potatoes started leaking liquid in a

(rip), i began to realize that pdi also had the best selection of beer within walking distance to my apartment. that and its late hours made for many an after-bar 6-pack trip for me.i have many fond memories of pdi, most of which i do not actually remember, but had recounted to me by the guys who run this place (\"how was the rest of your night last night?\" \"wait, i was here last night?\"), and this was one of few places in oakland that i was sad to leave behind when i decided to move. well, imagine my delight when i found out that a new location of pitt is doggn it had opened up right around the corner from my new apartment, just before i was about to move in! it must have been fate...the guys here are super friendly, and while this may look like a shady operation (okay, maybe it is), they are actually pretty knowledgeable about beer and can give you some good recommendations if they are out of what you want. they have an even wider selection of beers here than at the old location, the best selection in shadyside for sure. the prices are a little high but not obscene, and i find it to be worth the price for the convenience. if you live nearby, i would definitely recommend checking it out.","after trying to find some beer at a gas station (they do not sell it here), we came across this place. the staff was super friendly. they have a good selection of beer. higher end stuff and your cheap favorites. we chatted with the staff here for a few minutes. great people. i would give this a 5, but i did find it just a bit overpriced.","awesome selection of craft

this location is pretty terrible. do not even think about trying to get a parking spot on a saturday or sunday, unless you go close to when tj is opens. also, this location is definitely on the small side, and the aisles are extremely crowded on the weekends. i like to get there at 8am on saturday, and doing my shopping for the week. i generally do not have to fight crowds at thiser than those two minor complaints, i love this trader joes! the staff is the friendliest, and because i go so often, i know the aisles by memory. i always start at the bread/meat aisle on the far left side because there is always a huge bottleneck in the cereal/diary aisle because the doors open right onto it. some of my absolute favorite tj is products are the cheddar/gruyere hybrid cheese, the tuscan bagged kale, the gluten free savory crisps, the tj is organic lowfat cottage cheese, large tubs of the tj is vanilla greek yogurt, the tj is gluten free pastas (corn and brown rice-based), the tj is marinara sauce and whole peeled plum tomatoes, the boxed soups (organic tomato and roasted pepper and the corn and roasted red pepper are my favorites), and the selection of fresh, organic and/or all natural meats. these tj is products are things you ca not get anywhere else. everything i have ever tried with a trader joes label on it has been delicious.i find that i can usually do all of my grocery shopping here. there are only a few things i like to buy at whole foods or ge market district. love tj is!!","can it really be called trader joe is without Meaning to in Short Message Service buck chuck?   i understand that pennsylvania has different liquor laws, but i really miss my cheap trader joe is wine.as a native californian, i was overjoyed to find there was a trader joe is in pittsburgh.  it feels like a little slice of home to walk in and find some of the same products that i am used to on the west coast.  the prepared food section is not as extensive as the ones that i am used to, which is a bit of a bummer.  i also found the produce to be not so great.  not the most fabulous location that i have ever been to, but it will definitely fill my tjs void during my less than short stint in pittsburgh.","ample parking.  brightly lit.  friendly staff.  love the cheese and salad selection.  if you ever see the chile rellenos in the frozen section,  grab a few.  we usually buy all that they have they are so delicious.","great place, great prices. i go to the gym round the building so i stop by all the time to pick things up since i am there anyway. i have to say from the basics like milk and eggs to finding the items for a new meal to cook or even an awesome frozen/fresh meal for a fast dinner at a good price. they have everything you need. the prices are almost always the same and quality is always assured. it is not giant eagle where sales are not always a sale and everyday low price is a joke. it is nice to just walk in and know the price is as low as it goes with out having to check other stores or cut employees are always helpful and fast. if you ca not find something they will help you find it or get it from the back if they have it. they are also always polite and never seem miserable like other stores.","i am a huge fan of tj! so much so that i drive all the way from greensburg to stock up on things. the employees are friendly and fun and seem to like their jobs. i find it much less overwhelming than whole foods and i appreciate that it is smaller with a limited assortment of high quality private label items. make sure  you check sell by dates though!  i love the garlic hummus, whole grain pita chips, buffalo burgers, almond snack packs, coffee, cheese, frozen bell pepper blend, hemp protein powder and breads. it is a lot like aldi in many ways but with organic healthy foods. i like that it does not take an entire pay check to feed my family unlike other groceryo...be sure to check out the very bright nautical themed bathrooms.","a great alternative to the insanity that is giant eagle market district in shadyside. while the selection may not be as good, the quality and price of most items is pretty damn good. parking is pretty good (much better than giant eagle), though the shopping center can get a little crazy during rush hour. recently got some veggie burgers there that were amazing!","different layout than my usual california store, but the same products as all other trader joe is. there was a kind checker who gave us lots of halloween stickers for the kids. like every trader joe is i have ever been to, parking is crazy and people act like nuts in the parking lot. staff were helpful. i was sad they were out of the spicy thai chicken salad, it is the best salad there. at least they had buffalo jerky and mochi ice cream.","always enjoy tj is.... excellent people here. always cheerful and helpful. and..great bag packers!","definitely not the best trader joe is. upon arriving, i noticed lots of trash on the ground outside. inside, it was hectic, just like other trader joe is, but it felt crazier, crying babies and parents yelling at kids. i bought a chicken caesar wrap that was terrible, mostly consisting of cheese. the prepackaged food was fine, and the prices were like other tjs.","can you believe i just stopped here for the first time yesterday? i am sad i waited so long, i love it!!! the prices are so reasonable and the store is so cute and clean. it seems like everyone working is so friendly. the one worker was even talking to a customer on how to prepare this one meat he was interested in, how nice. i think i definitely found my new place to purchase groceries! i am so happy i found this spot!!!","friendly and helpful staff, great location, great food.  it is a good alternative to wholefoods, that is for sure.  very reasonably priced.","great place to shop. it would be nice if it was larger. get here early in the morning just as they open to avoid the crowd.","before a big move, most people check out the quality of schools, housing market, and overall affordability of the area . however, before i accepted my current job and moved 500 miles to pittsburgh, i did what any self-respecting twenty-something non-profit working dork would do: make sure i would be in close proximity to the glory that is trader joe is. i work in the arts, so i am not exactly raking in the cash, but that does not mean i ca not eat well. high quality food, low prices, excellent produce, and fantastic frozen entree/appetizer section. i am not a gourmet chef, but if i ever have a cocktail party and want to fool people into thinking i am, i am coming straight to tj is (i always drool over the spanakopita and mini quiches). the dark chocolate covered espresso beans are my go-too, unlike whole foods up the street, the parking lot here is not a nightmare, and free samples are always available.","heaven!  paradise!  utopia!  i went to my usual giant eagle looking for a thai peanut style dressing for a recipe i had gotten from trader joe is for thai peanut slaw.  it was not until this very moment after the few months i have been in pittsburgh that i suddenly and sadly realized how dismal the ethnic selection really was at my particular giant eagle (though i am betting that has something to do with location; maybe other branches are different).  anyway, that rant belongs on the g.e. review another time.i drove Meaning to in Short Message Service0 minutes out of my way just to get to this trader joe is, that is how badly i wanted to make the recipe.  upon arrival, i so realized i forgot how much i love trader joe is and what i had been missing all this time (sometimes you can be lulled into not missing something you do not see) -- selection, variety, ethnic food, food with flare, food with flavor.  seriously, my g.e. has exactly one aisle for all ethnic food and by ethnic at g.e., that includes the mexican-like and italian-like usual fare of taco shells andrything at trader joe is is packaged and displayed to be inviting.  there is a samples bar, there is friendly staff that seek you out before you have a chance to hunt them down to ask a question.  then they actually lead you to the aisle for the product in question.  the available cashier calls you over to their line and happily helps you and rings you up.  note that i had just come straight from my grocery shopping trip at g.e.  nevertheless, i was not going to pass up an opportunity to stock up on some flavorful additions from trader joe is.  for dinner, i spied Meaning to in Short Message Service spring rolls with shrimp with dipping sauce (and they were quite yummy, i might add).  i added the following to my cart for another day:  fresh stuffed pork chops, frozen pesto pizza, frozen shells with brie and asparagus, and frozen marsala dosa.  believe me when i say i wanted much, much more.  i will be back.  twenty minute drive from home?  ha!  i am not deterred.oh, and that recipe?  easy, peasy.  just toss together the items below....1 bag shredded green cabbage1/Meaning to in Short Message Service bag shredded carrots1/Meaning to in Short Message

with easy parking, lightning fast checkout times, and a healthy crowd in the store instead of being painfully jam-packed.for folks from pittsburgh, it is a grocery store that only sells one brand of generics; that brand is trader joe is.  they do not stock everything, as some things, they could not get generically relabeled to their store brand.  they do stock a really wide array of out of the ordinary stuff, most awesome selection of dried fruit/nuts/etc anywhere, and also at the best price.  great selection of frozen fish and vegetables, also at a great price.  best price on cut flowers in the city.  tasty hummus.  mediocrey are so-so on produce, and know it.  i am alright with that, as they carry the basics, and this is my store for dry/frozen goods, mostly.","i am a true trader joe is supporter.  the excitement  of shopping here never grows old though i try not to go there on the weekends.  i really enjoy discovering yet another new  product each time i shop and its really encouraging  to know  that i am seldom disappointed.  i especially enjoy the daily  product sampling and promotions they offer their store generally has plenty of help on hand for the amount of business they do and the lines at the registers move quickly.","great selection and reasonable prices. i also appreciate the fact that the majority of their products are organic.","all i could hear in my head was, \"haaaaaaaaaaaallelujah! haaaaaaaaaaaallelujah!\" when i walked through tj is doors on opening day. high quality food, fair prices, and friendly staff. and they are always giving out only

from us?? i have relatives in buffalo who drive here not to see me but to go here!","cheap prices for such good food. we have recently started to enjoy the chocolate and almond croissants in the frozen food isle. get them, trust me,  you will not be disappointed.","i am fortunate to work close-by to here.  they have high quality food items and a lot of things you cannot get elsewhere. i especially enjoy the numerous varieties of hummus and breads.  in addition they always have lots of fun fresh flowers to bring home to my wife!","how have i avoided trader joe is for so long?!?! i do not know if i can ever shop anywhere else! prices and selection are great. you can find all-natural and organic foods without paying the ridiculous whole foods prices. the fruits and veggies are cheap and fresh. they have a great selection of meats and cheeses and fresh flowers too. oh and the best part-- free samples! they were giving out samples of their frozen chicken pot pies and it was delicious. a little free food goes a long way! every staff member i saw was upbeat and very friendly with the customers. this is definitely my new grocery spot!","although the restaurant does not look particularly inviting from (plastic chairs and tables), but the food is excellent and as far as i can judge, also quite authentic. i love the samosas and the lentil and spinach dishes. however, everything is vegetarian, so not for meat lovers. you can also take it to-go home or to the hotel.","have you ever looked forward to grocery shopping? have you ever squealed with delight thinking about pushing a shopping cart through congested aisles to stand in long lines after having fought to find a decent parking space? i swear, trader joe is makes me smile ear to ear and not find a glimmer of annoyance in any of these things that would typically make me fly off the handle. why, you ask? because trader joe is is a culinary wonderland, full of new and delicious possibilities, healthy and affordable deliciousness, with vegetarian friendly options a go-go. my life and my lunch are forever better for having a trader joe is in my life. this was the first trader joe is location i had ever visited and it is still my favorite. the staff is incredibly helpful and kind and i know where everything is. but i still linger. i do not want to miss any of the new goodies they tuck in with my old favorites. my list of regularly purchased items continues to grow and my small trips to pick up basics now usually end up costing me well over $100. but for that cash i walk out of there with a cart full of things i am actually excited about preparing and eating. i used to think i could not do all of my shopping here and would supplement my tj runs with obligatory trips to giant eagle. now the only thing i go to giant eagle for is the pharmacy. chances are if trader joe is does not have it, i am not eating it. i would rather eat that canned tofu chili than my mother is best homemade effort (sorry mom, but have you had it?), the prepared veggie wraps and pasta salads are outstanding to have on hand for a quick lunch, and for a few months when the kale chips were removed from the shelves my wife and i talked about how we missed them almost daily. our pantry/freezer is nearly all tj is brand and that is the way we like it."]},"The Fresh Market":{"name":"The Fresh

my latest find was the buffalo chicken and blue cheese brats -  the wereir prepared foods may cost a little more but your tummy will appreciate it.","do you eat your candy bars with a fork and knife? then tfm is for you. just kidding. but seriously, as noted in other reviews. some items are a bit pricey. for instance, the prepared breaded chicken filets were over $5 each. wow. they were good but not 11$ for two good. the overall feel of the store is an open (fresh?) market with a small produce section, large butcher shop and prepared foods section. it definitely reminded me of something you would find in a busy downtown street in europe. small but a nice varied selection. the only issue with this is that if you are looking to stock up on produce because you only go to the grocery store once a week (rather than several times a week because it is on your way home and convenient like in many european towns) you wo not have much to choose from. i bought 8 pears and pretty much cleaned out the organic pear selection. on a positive note, i did find some organic produce options that you do not find at trader joe is or the local market district. they have bagged salads that are organic. some would say that it defeats the purpose of eating organic but to each his own. in the middle of the store is the large prepared foods section with various salads (pasta, quinoa, broccoli). they also have different flavors of rotisserie chicken which can also be purchased in pieces as a meal. also in the middle section s a very small salad bar and olive bar. there is a small deli and cheese section as well. one surprising note was the selection of bulk candy. there is an entire aisle of it. kinda crazy for such a small store. in the back of the store is the butcher shop and bakery. they were advertising their \"natural\" chicken without antibiotics. i asked about grass fed beef and was told that they only get it in a few days a year because it does not sell. um, did not they just open? moving on, the cakes looked incredible. i tried a chocolate croissant and bought a loaf of cheesy foccacia bread. eh. nothing special there. the other side of the store has packaged foods, dairy and cleaning supplies. the focus is on green natural and organic. i bought a couple yogurts that i had never seen before. overall, the staff were pleasant. the store was clean and well stocked. there are a variety of interesting and different items. but, with the parking situation, the prices and the small quantities of produce, tfm will probably only be a special occasion store for me. special note: not a god place to take a baby. there are no carts in the parking lot and the aisles are close together/packed. very easy for little hands to grab things.","fresh market opens in mt.

with marta showing us how the dough is made (with one person from the class assisting).  then she walks you through how one filling is made (potato and farmer is cheese with onion).  because of the class size and time, these steps are done for the group as a whole rather than individually.  once those initial steps are done, each participant is given their dough and filling and after brief instruction on the proper way to close the pierogi, you are let loose.  the nice thing is that the instructors are there for you to go over whether your dough is rolled thin enough, if you have the right amount of stuffing,er you finish your pierogis, you take them over to the pots and boil them.  you can eat them in the store that evening or take them home.  most people gobbled theirs up because they were so tasty.  i really look forward to seeing what class they offer next and will likely sign up shortly after it is announced.","delicious polish food, just like grandma used to make

was not a lot of foot traffic on the street. we were starving and crabby. i walked past edgar tacos and stopped in my tracks. i saw the mexican hot chocolate being stirred, my eyes got wide at the

them with incredible joy. the salsa was fresh and the chicken was cooked perfectly. i am going back asap!","delicious treat during your afternoon in the strip district! the picadillo tacos are awesome! the savory flavor of the beef with the fresh pico de gallo and cool sour cream is tasty! the cheese and squeeze of lime at the end cut through the richness of the meat and sour cream and add

time i eat at rose tea cafe, i am happy. they give rather large portions and are really authentic as i heard from my taiwanese friends. though the prices are a bit steep, especially for bubble tea( back in ny you can get it for much cheaper). however, their bubble tea is probably the best in pittsburgh, at least of all the ones i had so far.","i am currently living in cleveland, and no joke...this place is worth the two hour drive! the place is always busy, so if you have a big party you should definitely call and make a reservation. food=scallion pancake with beef- inside a crispy

sausages sweet, not salty. a simple dish, served with slices of garlic and very good. shredded pork with baby bamboo- i love bamboo, and mixed in with pork was a good side dish. three cup chicken- a very popular dish, and one i definitely love to order when i come here. the chicken is very tender and marinated in sauce so it is never dry. the sauce is made primarily of soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar and with ginger and basil. stinky tofu- although i have tried it multiple times, i am still not a fan of stinky tofu. surprisingly when my friends ordered it here, it was not as stinky as it usually is when cooked at other places. i wonder if that is a good or bad thing though haha. kimchi seafood hotpot- since one of our friends does not eat red meat, she got the kimchi seafood hotpot. it was hot and spicy, and over some rice it was very good. it is a good alternative for those that are in the mood for some seafood or something spicy. however, i ca not say it is the best kimchi seafood hotpot i have ever had. boba- i have had the milk tea and taro boba flavors before. i have to say, every time i get boba here i am never disappointed. it is always very fresh with just the right amount of sugar. some boba places can pack on the sugar, and you feel wired and just gross when you get to the bottom of the cup. but rose tea boba is one of the best i have had since moving to

shredded pork with baby bamboo shoots, kimchi fried rice, eggplant with garlic sauce, curry beef over rice, and their green tea with milk! their special meals (ex. curry beef over rice) are a great deal if you are a bubble tea fanatic like me and would like a special drink alongside your meal. in my opinion, their bubble milk tea is the best in the pittsburgh region. however if you are looking for a richer, milkier milk tea you might like everyday noodle better. the only qualms i have for rose tea cafe is that on busy days the staff can get quite frazzled and act in a rushed, brash manner. however, i have had good service most of the times that i have been. my favorite waiter is the lovely old man who works there. he always makes me smile!","good place for taiwanese/chinese food in

you get asked to leave because you are lounging around for too long after finishing your meal. although it seems it has been getting better lately. they are nicer to people they are familiarre is a wide selection of bubble teas, etc. my favorite is the yogurt smoothie. the yogurt is of the asian yakult yogurt drink variety and not the creamy yogurt you mayy have some standard specials, which are kind of like fast food. one of these is a fried chicken and rice plate. this is a safe thing to get if you have never tried taiwanese food.","best bubble tea in the burgh. i have bought green tea from

milk versions!","all food is pretty enjoyable there. i would not say amazing but you really ca not go wrong with anything on the menu.","authentic taiwanese foods, good price. not always clean-looking, though.","chicken curry. absolutely awful, tasteless, waste of time and money.  worst meal i have had in squirrel hill in 10 years. the chicken and vegetables (celery, onion, carrot)

food by any standard.  fresh, tasty, amazing soups on a cold pittsburgh day.  just do not go too late.","after eating at this place a few times now, i am still torn. either the dishes were a hit or a complete miss with me. here are some examples:all the bubble drinks i have gotten have been great!the ma pao tofu was very \"americanized.\" i am used to it with diced pork and much spicier. the tofu cubes were too big and had cubed carrots and peas, all which authentic ma po tofu does not stinky tofu was delicious. one of the things i always crave when i go back to taiwan. the tofu was fried perfectly with a little squeak to it every bite i took. the sauce was sweet and spicy (not in the traditional stinky tofu, but still good). also, the spicy fermented cabbage was a great compliment. i will try to update more as i try more dishes! i am willing to give this place more chances as most places here do not even have remotely close to the authenticity that rose tea cafe has.","had lunch here while visiting my buddy in pittsburgh. food is good and authentic but nothing spectacular to rave about. i love their extensive menu with all the taiwanese dishes that i love growing up. bubble tea here is awesome as i can tell the bubbles are not left overs from previous night on the few occasions i stopped by. price is reasonable with pretty good portion. only complaint i have is the staff. we got there 5mins before they open but they refuse to let us wait inside. then the staff was a little reluctant at first but did warmed up eventually and got friendlier.","decent but nothing spectacular about this mom and pop restaurant that serves taiwanese style cafe food. the menu is a little bit too long for my liking, but it does provide a wide selection of everything (you can even get stinky tofu here). every time i come here i just stare blankly at the menu and then get a headache dishes here are okay. pretty decent comfort food to me. the best thing about this restaurant is the fact that you cant get this type of food anywhere else","ca not say i agree with the \"authentic\" claims that other people have made for this place.  while it has some of the more palatable chinese food i have had in pittsburgh so far, it was not a meal that i felt satisfied the unbearable ache i have been feeling in my stomach for good chinese food that i have had since moving here from one thing, no authentic taiwanese breakfast.  for another thing, ma po tofu, in my recollection, involves not only tofu but also minced pork.  we got some tofu floating in a sea of thick sauce that was... not... ma po... tofu...curry over rice was pretty good.  again, i am not saying that place is bad.  but seriously folks.  this is not authentic chinese food.","best three cups chicken (taiwanese chunk chicken) and beef stew noodle soup in the city.  they also have stinky tofu! though it could be quite a bit stinkier.  protip:  get the hot bubble teas.","delicious. comparable to la

yummy! the beef onion cake rolls were a great appetizer!lack of one star goes to the drinks. those can be better. the almond milk tea was powdery. i think if the girl was not on her phone so much it might have tasted better with some more effort.i think pittsburgh needs a tapex or a fantasia!!!","having just moved to pittsburgh, i was apprehensive about trying \"chinese\" food in a city where steel and blue collar worked reigned supreme for so many years.  however, i happened upon this little restaurant and heard from another chinese guy that this place was actually decent.i was surprised to find that they are actually a taiwanese establishment.  so, going back to my younger days eating authentic taiwanese food in socal, i decided on the pork chops with rice.  when the food came, the plate contained Meaning to in Short Message Service nicely fried pieces of taiwanese-style pork chop that were actually really tasty - a  little hint of sweetness, well seasoned, and not dry.  a portion of rice, preserved vegetables, and a soy-sauce hard boiled egg topped it off. also ordered the passion fruit tea with tapioca.  pretty damn tasty.   at $6.Meaning to in Short Message Service5 for the plate and another $Meaning to in Short Message Service.50 for the drink, it was actually quite a deal.  i have yet to try their black bean sauce noodle (which the waiter said was excellent), but for now i am pretty surprised at how good the food was.  as a newly transplanted san franciscan in pittsburgh, i am super hesitant to try any form of asian food, but this dish was legit.","excellent bubble tea. good service, and very good food. i have tried all the bubble tea places in the area, and rose tea is the best. very authentic taiwanese cuisine.","authentic asian

grab bagels for the road.  we grabbed a baker is dozen of assorted bagels and some house-made cream cheese. the garlic herb creme cheese is *awesome* (filled with chunks of garlic).    the bagels were quite tasty: substantial, chewy, and delicious. the veggie bagel was particularlyvice was good and low-key.  recommended.","fantastic nova lox bagel! certainly carb breakfast of choice- nova lox

with the lox spread. mostly cream cheese and  maybe two lox pieces of shredded fish (much smaller than chunks). seriously skimping on the lox. other than the non-existent lox in the spread, the food in the display case looked very tasty.","despite the fact that i eat here frequently-purely because of convenience and lack of a better option-the bagels are mediocre, the service is slow, and the

were great. be aware, they butter all the bagels before they put the other toppings on so if your a health but ask for no butter. cute little shop though.","bagel factory is one of those places i had not stopped at in awhile, so after a morning of strolling and shopping in the neighborhood, i thought i would have a revisit.  truth be told, ruggeri is is actually my favorite place now in squirrel hill for a sandwich.  but since i am off work all week, i figured i could stop there on another day.i was in the mood for a good sandwich though and i thought i would try \"reuben is sister rachel\".  a rachel is basically corned beef on deli rye with kraut, swiss, and russian dressing.  my sandwich was a good, nuthin fancy, basic, solid fare.  bagel factory is okay in my book and i have got to admit theirs are w-a-y better than bruegger is!  but the carbs, the carbs!","great matzo ball soup! this place is very filling. all of their bread is delicious here. obviously they are all about bagels, and their bacon, egg and cheese is typically my favorite. it is a greasy bagel because they make that bacon sizzle so you have been warned if greasy is not your thing. when it comes to cream cheese, many places that serve bagels only give you a small portion barely enough to spread but not here! they lather it on so thick you have to eat it slice by slice rather than as a bagel sandwich. some of my friends think it is too much and they like to take some off or just order it with less but i love cream cheese goodness on every bite. each order is made as you like it so if you do not want it to be cream cheese with a side of bagel like me then simply tell them to go light on the cream cheese. this place aims to serve and they do it well.","i am an out-of-towner, but when i am in squirrel hill, i always make sure to stop here for a egg sandwich and a few bagels to go. the super cinnamon and the whole wheat are particularly lovely.","bagels!!!!  delicious bagels!!the bagel factory is one of my favorite nom-related establishments in my neighborhood.  we do not get bagels from there often (we have to walk a whoooole block and a half to get there....we are lazy) but i suspect as summer approaches and warm weather inspires me to walk around the neighborhood, it will happen.  their bagels are so delightful.  fresh, delicious smelling and tasting, and they know how to properly season an everything bagel.  those bagels should not just be everything, but everywhere.  i would like my poppy seeds, onion, and sesame seeds on the top and the bottom of said bagel.  otherwise one half is amazing and one half is essentially plain.  bagel factory understands this.so i went there for breakfast for the first time about a week ago, and ordered matzah brie, for fun.  i make it myself, but i thought i would try their version.  so i order it, and the dude behind the counter is like \"and what kind of bagel would you like?\"  and i am all \"does not compute....\" and he is like \"it comes with a bagel.\"  ......matzah comes with a bagel?  carbs + carbs = breakfast?  okay!so i got an everything bagel with cream cheese, and fried matzah (which had yummy onions in it).  a really weird breakfast, and i was sort of craving like...fruit or something....but all the components were delicious.  oh and i had a chai tea.  also tasty.  hard not to be.i would definitely come back here for more brunches, but i think i would just get a bagel sandwich of some sort, to avoid the carb+carbo, do you know how hard it is to walk past that ben and jerry is counter?  even at like, 10 am on a sunday?  in winter?  holy moly.  too much tastiness in one place.  if the bagel factory ever implodes, we will know why.  ice cream and perfect bagels under one roof may be too much for the structural integrity of the building to handle.","best bagels in pittsburgh- if you get them fresh!...wait until the end of the day and they are rock solid. unfortunately, service here is terrible. a glacier moves faster than the line at bagel factory and the system is incredibly inefficient. go to brueggers down the street if you are in a rush. and do not bother asking if they will slice your bagels- the wo not do it- even if you are the only  customer in the store and are willing to pay extra. the cashier (an older/middle-aged woman) seems to be in a permanent bad mood and gets

the end product is just as cool and refreshing, but the actual yogurt is thinner and less tart than what i am used to.  it is still better than tcby, but with dave and andy is just up the street, you

have been here it is been for something different, and it is always been a decent time. there is no great atmosphere or anything, but it is a comfortable place to hang out in. i have noticed a lot of complaints about the servers but every time i have been there they have seemed pretty down to earth. the specials are good and i am a fan of their happy hour. all the food i have tried has been decent bar grub. i would not stay there all night but it is good for a beer or two.","best salad in pittsburgh - the cog. grilled chicken, avocado, red onion, bacon, blue cheese crumbles, hard cooked egg, awesome lettuce mix and delish homemade balsamic dressing! they have incredible fries - seasoned to perfection! burgers are great, too. cool decor and a nice small menu. nothing super fancy, just good food! service can be a bit slow at lunch but they do get busy and do a lot of take out.","great place. must stop if you are a cyclist. food is good bar food with cyclist themed names. i always stop when in pitt for a minute.","aye yie yie, i had to update this review because i did not even mention their food before! it is. so. good. great burgers and fries. oh, i love their fries. had fish tacos at the new north park location and they were really good, loved the pineapple salsa -- plus not too heavy. seriously, it is all so good. i love the pierogies, the salads, even the hummus is great!it is just really good bar food, with a wide selection and cozy, comfy atmosphere. you do not have to be a bicycle enthusiast to want to come here!","both times i have been here, have been great. the burgers are outstanding, and as filling as it gets! i love the atmosphere and if you are a current cyclist, this is the place for you!i will admit the service is not spectacular, like others have said on here. the bartender i had the last time i was there was not the most sociable. when asking questions about the menu, she acted as if it was a hassle. not the mostrall, the food is great. if you go on tuesdays it is $Meaning to in Short Message Service corona is & $1 taco is! ca not beat that.","going off of my last review... i still genuinely want to love this place... but just find it really hard to do so.my boyfriend and i were looking for a bite in southside, and since i had a city dining card for otb, we decided to stop by. we sat at the bar, like we always do, and my boyfriend ordered a beer. the beer he ordered was literally the only beer that sounded appealing on their entire draft list (which consisted of 8 beers). this is the third time that i have gone and have been completely unimpressed by their selection. i almost always order a beer when going out to eat, especially to a bar, but i was so unamused with their selection that i chose water instead.we started off with two appetizers - hot pepper cheese sticks and fried pickles. we had a choice between marinara and ranch for our cheese sticks- i asked for ranch. i was given marinara. not a big deal. what really turned me off was that Short for for in Short Message Service fried pickles cost $7.... are you kidding me? yes, they were good.. but not great... and absolutely positively not worth $7. i found that to be outrageous. the hot pepper cheese sticks were not very hot at all, but were decent. my boyfriend ordered the pittsburgh burger and really liked it. he was completely full after eating the burger and barely touched the fries. i ordered the buffalo chicken wrap. the chicken was grilled and flavorless. i needed to ask for frank is red hot to give the wrap some flavor. overall, i was really disappointed and honestly do not plan on returning for dinner. i did enjoy their taco night last time i had went, and would consider going back for that... or to check out their healthy menu, which i hear is  quite good.","hmm...what to say about this place.  the location was convenient as it was close to southside works.  yea...that is about service was terrible.  our waiter looked like a flock of seagulls wannabe and had the personality of a doorknob.  we asked for beer suggestions and were a bit snubbed.  it is not like this place offered fancy martinis, so i knew the waiter could offer at least one beer from their draft selection.  the crowd was a bit unique, but seemed to be having a fun time.  there was a live band the night i was there, so had i stayed longer, i may have enjoyed the night a bit more.  it is hard to not judge a place based on one person, but this place gave me no choice.  i will not be making a return trip to this bar.  ever.","had the fixie.  great burgers. peanut butter and jelly on beef just sound like a trio.  i was wrong.  great burger great place. i highly recommend the fixie","felt wayyyy out of place hanging out here, being that everyone else there were bicyclists hanging out after a cycle-in-your-underwear charity thing, but it was the first place we came across and it wound up being a fun place to hang out.  great beer selection, a lot of interesting beers i have not tried before at pretty good prices.  had a really good waitress, too.","great weekly specials and atmosphere(laid back vibe). innovative burgers and sandwiches. friendly customers. good music is always playing in the background. outside seating is available. awesome concept bar with great service that is far from the run-of-the-muck southside dive or frat party. check it out!","great food, good atmosphere, nice beer selection.  highly recommend for a casual meal and/or drink!","best food in the southside,amazing atmosphere,$Meaning to in Short Message

delicious!  everything!  i had heard so much about the burgers that i was really tempted to get one... but trying to be on the good side (and knowing i was heading to the gym later and did not want to be slugging it on the elliptical) i went with a better for you option....the major taylor cycling salad sounded right up my ahi loving alley!  i love my ahi tuna and still always get surprised to see it at non seafood type places (although i feel like it is becoming more common at all sorts of places).  my friend also ordered the ahi tuna.  must not stock up on it, or it is not ordered a lot, because the waitress came back and said there was only one left.  yikes!  my friend went with another options (is not she so nice!) and i got the salad still.  now here is the thing... i eat a lot of salads.  i have had fantastic, un-boring salads, totally boring salads and just so so salads.  you can make a salad exciting.  this salad teetered on boring.  it was not bad, ahi tuna was okay.  top that off with a smattering of carrots and a little less spring mix than i would have liked and there it is.  so, knowing they are known for their burgers i will go back when i want to be bad.  but i think if they are a stellar place the salad will also be amazing.  so, watch for me, i will be back and i am going to be so bad!","another episode of \"if it is not broken, do not fix it.\"the pug and i stopped by for lunch last week and noticed a smaller, scaled down regular menu and a grandiose menu for body building. what?! they have partnered up with a cross fix or fitness place to offer double chicken breast sandwiches, and other items loaded with protein. my guess is that they are trying to appeal to the la fitness clientele as well. either way, they took the veggie velomuse off of the menu, which was my favorite. they do have plenty of veg options, which deserves bonus points, but that sandwich was the bees knees.","******be aware when using your credit card*****i have visited this place multiple times recently( i know, shame on me) and used my credit card to pay for my meal. every single time, i am double charged on my card. eventually one of the charges falls off, but your money is tied up for a week(or more) waiting for the \"pending transaction\" to fall off. the food , atmosphere, and beer are above average, but this little hassle makes me want to quit goinge is an example of my past weekendfriday - pending charge (Meaning to in Short Message Service dollars) - ok, so you need to swipe my card and get auth. no biggiefriday - pending charge (58 dollars) - great, now you charged my card minus a tip. the way it is suppose to betuesday - Meaning to in Short Message Service dollar pending charge is gone; 58 dollar pending charge is gone(being replaced by my 75

re-ran my card for stuff i already paid forso buyer, be aware. do not go to this place if you use credit/bank card for your transactions like i do","bike porn on the tv. great beer selection.  food has gotten even better since we first went here when they opened.   one,  if not my favorite,  places to go in the southside.","do not you dare drive here. just kidding. maybe. this place is adorable - the decor is basically tgif but tgfb thank god for bikes, and you can sit under the imposing and awe-inspring shadow of a trike, or mountain bike, or classic road bike....take your pick, then listen for the sound of the bike bell a-dinging to alert waitresses when your food is ready! did i mention bikes? bikes bikes bikes. on my bike - i mean burger! - i had bacon added to an already-quirky combination of beef, fresh peanut butter, and blackberry preserves (\"the fixie\"....of courrrrse). delicious. the fries are way, way above average - like tall bike above average. good, local beer selection on tap that changes pretty frequently. they brought out penn brewery is chocolate stout yesterday, and i had some today - awesome! i would say more, but i can already see you grabbing your u-lock and heading out the door....pee ess, bike safe :d","i am amending my rating after my latest visit to otb. it was open mic night, and the bar was hopping, though i would not have called it overly busy by any means...it was only Parent is watching oclock. the pissed-off bartender did not exactly make our visit pleasant. he was short with us and seemed entirely unconcerned with providing good service. when my husband went to the bar to ask for a menu he just pointed to the corner where the stack of menus sat, which turned me off right away. he seemed to be the only one actually working the front, so i can excuse some of his poor attitude, but not all. the food came and it was ok. we paid, not much of a thank you or have a nice night from the bartender once again. so yeah, we might give this place another chance in the future, but it is not on my must list.","cyclist or not, veggie or not, this is a great place to meet some friends, have a brew, and munch on some scrumptious apps.  the servers have been inviting and friendly the couple of times that i have been to otb. i have sampled the fried pickles which were pretty standard and i have ordered the beer cheese soup and seitan wings with \"lickers\" sauce. have not had a bad thing yet...unless you want to include my mini sized bloody mary that had no vodka in it or garnish. hey, sometimes beggars can not be choosers so im willing to overlook that. they have rotating microbrews on tap that make up for it.","best fries. lots of vegetarian options. unique burgers. cool decor. friendly waiters/bartenders.","good food, good beer, staff is always friendly even when the place is packed, bike friendly parking, lock and pump available if needed. this is a place for anyone to go to and enjoy, not just cyclists or a specific genre of cyclist.","good hamburgers, superb seitan wrap, and great selection ofn it comes to seitan, it is a hit or miss.i love seitan wings but a few times i have gotten them they have been too soggy or too crunchy (overcooked) but most of the time,ir service is good (not sure why some complain about that in the north hills location) seeing that both places have the same owner. too bad their bathrooms are too small to have a changing table. now that we are three we still like to go out and take our (quiet) little one with us. she loves hanging out and seeing new faces.","food was great - atmosphere wonderful - i like how the bar area and eating area a separate enough.  fried zucchini wrapped around cheese - so yummy!  makes the decision easy between getting zucchini or mozzarella sticks - both in one!  delicious veggie burger with fresh mozz and cooked spinach and red peppers!","came back to try one of their vegetarian burgers - it was great! portabello mushroom on top of blue cheese and a veggie burger. seriously one of the best veggie burgers i have ever had - burgers were a $1 off on special that day. i really like how they rotate what they have on draft.we really hope they stay in business, there were not many people there for happy hour and it was very quite. i think this is one of the best places to take kids in the south side that is not part of a chain. they are really friendly and they have a kids eat free day. still the best place to go before a movie!","after dreaming of otb is seitan wrap for *years* since i have moved away to ca, i was sorely disappointed today.  the seitan was extremely dry, and the pita bread was literally charred to a crisp all the way through.  after talking with the waitress about it, it was decided that i would get 50% off.  before our food arrived, one of the staff snapped a photo of my little nephew in his dirtrag shirt.   she was really sweet, but we joked at the end that we should have told her that she could only use \"50%\" of the photo.  service was also very slow.","absolutely love this place. the burger with peanut butter is my favorite burger anywhere, and the beer selection speaks to me. the bike-theme is icing on the cake. wish we had something exactly like this in los angeles...","cool small bar on the southside away from all the craziness that goes on up carson street. very good draft selection which always has a couple local micros on tap including east end brewery. the bottle selection is extensive.  beer prices here are a bit high, but every night they have a different micro brewery on special where you get $Meaning to in Short Message Service off drafts and bottles. for example wednesday night is $Meaning to in Short Message Service off great lakes and thursday is a oskar blues special.i have heard great things about the food here, but when i came to check out the otb i had just finished dinner so i was not hungry. but the menu looked great and the food i was seeing being brought out from the kitchen smelled really good staff is friendly with a really laid back and chill vibe so do not be afraid to strike up some conversation. i will definitely be back to check out the food sometime. people say this is a hipster bar, but it seemed like a varied mix of people who enjoy a cool establishment. or maybe i am a hipster and just have not admitted it yet. hope more places like this keep popping up on the sside.","after enjoying otb is north park location this past summer a family member and i decided to try their south side location. i admittedly preferred the tranquility of their park location, but in fairness i doubt that i will ever find true tranquility in the bustling south side. that is just not in this area is nature!we visited on a thursday so very few people were actually in the place. everyone who was there that night had gathered in the bar area, so once we moved to the back dining area we had an entire section to ourselves. thankfully the speakers in the back were not super loud (they could have been a bit quieter though). we got our orders in quickly and our meals were ready before we would finished our appetizer, so needless to say our service is speed was not an issue that night.as for the food, i enjoyed it overall. bicycle cafe specializes in tasty sandwiches and also delivers enormous amounts of food in large quantities. my main course was their special blt, which in addition to the normal ingredients has egg, avocado and chipotle mayo on it. i ate that whole thing in addition to my appetizer - pierogies - like a complete glutton. my only complaint about the food was that their pierogies were a little overcooked, but still, they were tasty so i can forgive that.at the end of the meal two sandwiches (with sides), an appetizer and a beer cost us a whole $Meaning to in Short Message Service5 - not a bad deal, i have to say. if we had not ordered the pierogies we still would have had enough food and our meal would have cost under $Meaning to in Short Message Service0, so i will definitely keep these guys in mind as a tasty cheap eats option for the next time i am in the area!","came here as the end point for the east end brewery is yearly beer biking event. ca not comment on the food or beer here since i only had east end beer, but the bar seemed clean and friendly. it also appeared to be smoke free, but the night i was there was slightly unusual. interesting dcor with bikes hanging from the ceiling; i will definitely come back here on a more normal night.","as much as i want to love and adore this place, i would say it is a step above mediocre in terms of their beer selection and their food. i love the way this bar is decorated. the ceiling is painted really colorful and there is even a bike hanging from the ceiling as well... pretty awesome. both times that i have eaten here i have sat at the bar. the bartender was friendly both times as well. the first time i came i ordered boulders mojo risen ipa... delicious. the second time i came here i ordered a great lakes pilsner. i have to say their craft beer selection can be improved... both times that i have gone there have been about three beers offered that were something i might be interested in.. and overall they only have about 8 or so beers on tap at all times. not the selection i hope for in a bar. i really like the fact that this place offers so many vegan and vegetarian options. the first time i came i ordered the dirty bella tacos with marinated portabella mushrooms and slaw- messy but delicious. the meal also came with corn and beans. the second time i came it was taco tuesday! $1 chicken or beef tacos and $Meaning to in Short Message Service shrimp or portabella tacos. i ordered one chicken, two mushroom and one beef. i received one chicken, two mushroom and one shrimp.. i did not complain though- i kind of wanted to try the shrimp taco anyway. they were pretty good. the chicken was a little cold and the shrimp was nothing more than small fried shrimp... the mushroom tacos are by far my favorite.. they put salsas and guacamole on their tacos as well. overall, it is an awesome bar- just nothing too special or out of this world. i definitely will return for more portabella tacos on taco tuesday though!","good burgers and salad. amazing fries. great healthy choices on menu. i usually get the cog salad. service is kind of slow though.","fun as hell on trivia night. great vibe and awesome beer list with on point service. loved it and will be back! love the paintings on the ceiling. fun place on the east end of carson. check it out!","friday night regular. the food is awesome (fried pierogi, hummus, seitan wings, burgers [do not forget the peanut butter], fried pickles), the theme is perfect, drinks are strong--what else do you want?pbr is always two bucks. well drinks are around three bucks. you do not get the obnoxious bros and drunk skanks that fall all around the lower blocks of east carson. usually filled with Meaning to in Short Message Service0-something \"bike kids,\" but you will get everything here from yuppies to families with children (they do have a kids menu!).outdoor seating, back \"dining room\" with a large screen for sports and whatnot, awesome environment. mini bike corral on the storefront (instead of parking spots). it does get a little overrun by kids on weekend evenings, but it is honestly not that bad. overall, i ca not say enough good things about this place.","had a beer here while barhopping on the southt little bicycle-themed bar with cool decor and decent beer list. some awful slasher movie was on tv which actually transfixed me and my friends. not too crowded, but seemed

the drink. i picked this because i thought i would not eat at much and i would have room to try one of their ice cream treats.  wrong!  the amount of cheese put on the pizza was more than enough and really filled me up. i did not even have enough room to get the free refill for my drink. my friend first decided to get half a meatball hoagie, but the staff directed him to get the special, a whole hoagie and drink for less than a buck more.  he also got an order of fries.  we were informed that they were not even going to have hoagies when they first opened and just by chance started. once they caught on, the rest is history. everything is cooked right after you order. and i mean fresh from the oven. even the fries go in the oven, no fryer here (healthy fries, yes please).  you can tell this place is meant for the warmer months too, with a window to order from on the sidewalk. only four tables inside for indoor dining.  during warmer months i am sure most people would like an ice cream

imagine their espresso-based drinks or their brewed coffee could be that good just based on the machines they are using and their brewing technique--but, i do not know for sure.  lastly, i have found

conference sponsored by the highmark foundation at the omni. came early to check out the taproom since i love craft beer. the bartender was rude from the moment i walked in, looking at me as if i did not belong. when i asked for a beer, it seemed to put her out that she had to do something. when i server asked her for a water, she sighed loudly and rolled her eyes. i have stayed at omni is in the past and have always had excellent service. if this bartender is so miserable at work with the public, perhaps she should consider a new line of work if she dislikes interacting with the public so

it is our go-to coffee place nearby because of its friendly baristas and delicious coffee. very easy to get work done with a cuppa joe since they have several large tables to use. they even have a little kids play area!will definitely be back for more!","i am a tea drinker so i ca not vouch for the coffee but the tea here is great! you can also get made to order breakfast sandwiches. nice quiet atmosphere, and good central location on forbes.","charges for extra shot of espresso when it is thrown away anyway. generic, uninspired, completely mediocre. try the crazy mocha Meaning to in Short Message Service blocks away","caribou coffee on the u pitt campus is fantastic! good coffee, comfortable ambiance, and free wi-fi make it a great place to study with a cup of coffee. i love their rustic furniture. you must try their cold-pressed iced coffee with a shot of white chocolate. so good.","disclaimer: i do not drink coffee. i do not like the smell of coffee. i do not eat baked goods made with coffee. all that being said, caribou is my favorite coffee place. weird!i love tea. chai specifically, but i also enjoy black tea, green tea, red tea, you get the idea. i also dig a fruit smoothie now and then. but this review is mostly about me seeking out a coffee place to grab a chai latte. and caribou is way better than starbucks, and in a different stratosphere than the subpar chai at crazy mocha. in the fall months, they also offer a pumpkin chai, which pretty much blows my mind. it is insanely good. i wish they offered it year round, i am always in the mood for pumpkin! that is my jam!i would love if caribou got franchised the way crazy mocha has. i would love to see one in every neighborhood, like starbucks. the vibe is comfortable with light wood tones and lots of seating. the staff at the oakland location is friendly and fast, there is free wifi, and they have crazy good chai. what else could a non-coffee drinker ask for!?","as an avid coffee fan, i have to say that caribou has won me over. they have free wi-fi, which is great if you find yourself in the area and you need to do some work via computer. when you walk in the door, you feel like you have left the southside and entered a cozy ski lodge. they even have a fireplace surrounded by big, comfy chairs -definitely a plus when you are looking for a place to relax and sip on some espresso. one of the cool things about caribou is that it has a wider variety of menu items than your typical coffee shop. the oatmeal (try their blueberry almond flavor, so good!), breakfast sandwiches and snacks are much better than what you can get at your local starbucks. if you are not a coffee person, caribou also has some really good flavored teas. overall, a great place to get your caffeine fix.","friendly staff knows many customers by name. coffee as good as anywhere else. nice location.","free refills on coffee. now that is sweet. i dig caribou coffee, i dig its cozy feel and the friendly staff. i am digging sitting next to the window and watching all the forbes avenue craziness when i should be writing. the only problem is that during the college school year this place often gets so packed you ca not find a seat. but you will have that when all the students are in oakland. if you find a seat you will enjoy yourself, but good luck finding one monday through thursday during the afternoon. that seems to be study time at pitt.","a nice alternative to starbucks if you want to try different variations on what starbucks offer.  i was happy to see that the wifi was really simple to use, no accepting terms or passwords, just connect and your ready tos location has a ton of tables so it makes for a good place to study.  they do not have many comfy chairs though, i think i only saw two.a nice touch is the fireplace for those cold nights."]},"Giant Eagle":{"name":"Giant Eagle","longitude":"-80.0662223","latitude":"40.3923379","reviews":["definitely not glamourous, but

lacking in many areas but debbie in customer service area needs to be applauded for her can do attitude . she has helped me out on several occasions and solved many problems .","i agree with other reviews, this store is poorly laid out and honestly makes no sense. sometimes bigger is not always better. i used to head here often while living near shadyside to stop at the family dollar & hit ge in one run. i normally only stopped here for a redbox movie. my debit card got hacked at an outdoor redbox at a get go so i will only go to a redbox that is indoor like this one. anyways, i would hit up the liquor store for some wine afterwards for dealing with long lines/wait & awkward clientele outside.","as a petite, young, white female, i am fearful to go here alone. i choose this giant eagle (most of the time) over the big market district one on center avenue because it is easier to find a place to park, and you can run in and grab what you need quickly. however, i feel like i walk around with my purse clutched tightly to my side and have to watch my back. the clientele that hang out/shop here is not the greatest. there is a police officer that sits at the front of the building, which is good, that makes me feel a bit better. most cashiers are friendly and nice. some are very slow. the shift supervisor that hangs out around the cash registers is extremely unfriendly and often shows little disregard for her job, her employees, and customers. more than once she has yelled at me to \"move faster\" when using the self checkout, and when my self checkout lane has needed the assistance of an employee because it was not working, she makes sure you know you have bothered her from what she was doing. i ca not wait to return to this giant eagle so i can get her name and post it on my yelp review. hopefully someone will get her some customer service training or etiquette classes.","as far as ge is go, this location is great. it has basically everything you need and is well organized. you can find a lot of ethnic ingredients you ca not get at other ge stores. they also offer a wine kiosk, hot bar, salad bar, and bulk olives. i would venture to say this is better than the market district.","a very oddly laid out supermarket. the deli isle is not very wide, the the walls are closing in on you, and they put the diy olive cart in front to make it more cluttered. just a poorly laid out store which is showing it is age.","giant eagle gets a bad rap, but i really like this place, especially in retrospect. the one-stop type grocery stores i have been to since have been nowhere near as nice.  fair selection of no-hormones-added meats, including cold cuts, chicken, turkey and beef. nice (for pittsburgh), fresh produce on thursdays. good selection of frozen stuff. the pharmacy staff is accommodating (if they can help, they do) when they are not swamped.  actually, i really like all the staff, except (i think) the frozen foods manager, who i have seen act like a real can also send a fax (if they are not super-busy with lottery sales) and make copies - handy in greenfield.  same goes for the waterfront location, where they have even more specialty and organic items.","decent giant eagle to cover the necessities. i would drive out of the way but do not mind shopping here if in the area.","been yelled at by other customers (today for instance)...place is super ghetto...avoid at all cost. today, left a full cart bacause a woman (with a baby in a stoller) shouted at me for \"cutting in line\". will never go back. at night it is a nightmare.","fresh produce and helpfull staff !!","busy, confusing, crazy parking lot.","came to this location for a quick run in and i regret it immensely.  decided to get a giant eagle card since my item was on sale.  the clerk at customer service was so rude i took my id back and walked away.  her language was impossible to understand and when i did not understand her second mumbling she yelled her question at me.  this happened twice.  they wo not ever see me here again.","great location, nice employees.  could do better on the service.","awful.  i did not know how bad it was until i went to a different ge and saw how good it could be.  the lines are long, the produce selection is minimal, and the store is last straw was yesterday when the cashier blew her nose, stuck kleenex up her nose, then put it back in her pocket and continued to scan groceries.  when i complained to the manager, they denied any of their employees were sick.i am done shopping at this store.","gross. busy. morning cashiers on their phones walking around ignoring customers using profanity. where are the managers?","holy canoli. this is the strangest giant eagle i have ever seen. the layout is totally weird.. aisles are like diagonal and there is a freezer section right as you walk in? check out is hidden around the corner from the entrance.. only thing worse is the parking lot which is an accident waiting to happen.","argh, you dirty little cramped place you.  if you was not for your late hours (until 1-ish) and proximity to where i live, i would not frequent you.  i am so confused when i shop here.  do you remember that kid is game show \"fun house?\"  it is kind of like walking into that.  having to look for a clue as to where to find the item you want/need.  i swear i walked around for 15 minutes once looking for the bread aisle only to discover that the bread was on the ends of several aisles (your clue) and you had to figure out which endcap you needed for the correctng later at night makes it hard to shop, especially since they are in full swing with restocking the shelves.  (yet another piece to that fun house puzzle)  do not go for big orders ever here, be sure to have a small list and avoid grabbing a cart, you will just add to the congestion.  if at all possible, use the self check outs.","i agree with the below poster.  i like giant eagle because they have everything someone needs.  they accept double coupons, have fuel perks, and are just the local grocery

mixed with the veggies (they added a middle eastern style pickled cucumber) were a crunchy, delicious dessert we got this mesmerizingly orange dessert that i later learned was called jalebi. it was light and airy and completely drenched in delicious, sweet syrup. it was interesting to say the grocery next door is incredible as well, especially the butcher is area. fresh meat hangs on hooks right

slightly creaky wood floors and back patio remind me of my gram is house ... cozy, comforting, with big chairs and old furniture that beg to be sat in. it is just ... not corporate coffee. and for those of us who live the corporate lifestyle, having coffee in that kind of space is reassuring that the world is still an okay place. they use intelligentsia beans, a question that a few folks have seemed to pose and i think other yelpers have mentioned but the reviews might be a bit buried at this point. they roast in chicago and la, so chances are if you have had a cup somewhere in those metro areas, you have probably had it before. other things of note ... amazing gelato in the summer; always an oatmeal bar for breakfast and soup bar for lunch (soups are all homemade), and a ridiculously tempting selection of biscotti and scones/other treats that coffee deserves to spend time with. and ... free wi-fi! whoop whoop!","charming, comfortable, and when the barista recommends the chocolate

paragraph unto themselves.  the tea selection is extensive.  you get your leaves loose in a small french press (and you also get a second fill of hot water included).  they have plenty of caffeinated coffee creations to keep you happy if that is what you are in to - i personally lean more coffee than tea.  this is the place that will give you a funny look if you order a macchiato but really mean

attention to detail, baked goods and other food selection is extensive, tea is fresh and loose, hours are great (open later)cons: baristas are sometimes a little curt and impersonal unless you are a regular, can be hard to find a seat if it is a day that everyone comes in at the same time, real talk: the ladies room is always freezing! what is up with that?","great coffee place ... probably the best one i have been to in pittsburgh. the place itself is quite nice as there is not only a variety of indoor seating available (couches, chairs, tables), but also a great outdoor area that makes a

gelato bar, oatmeal bar, bakery pastries/breads, and a number of tea offerings too. i have to admit, i was quite impressed by that alone.i ended up getting the caramel latte for my first cup and it was absolutely pristine. great & smooth taste and the amount of milk and sugar was just perfect! i thoroughly enjoyed it. i also got a mocha for my second cup and it was just as good, albeit more powdery than i anticipated ... may have to do with a small amount of cocoa powder used in the brew that was not completely dissolved, but regardless the drink had a similar consistency, temperature,

need for a good street taco.  the best part is the taco barrista squeezes fresh lime juice on top of the taco as a finishing touch. it really puts it over the top.","finally made it to the taco stand on a crisp, sunny december!! i had one solitary fish taco as i was running low on cash. but it was worth it. put on some of their hottest hot sauce (which hit the spot), sat down at one of the tables

quiet.  i got a chicken salad and the charming turkish woman (totally assuming, but she seemed authentic!) hooked me up with eggplant, chick peas, and potatoes on top of my salad dressed with a creamy white yogurt best part was the potatoes and the eggplant.  they were flavorful, tender, and a perfect compliment to the crunchy lettuce.  the chick peas were nice and bright as well and a great counterpart to the \"heavier\" flavors.  the chicken would have been my favorite part in all of it is tender, juicy glory, but we had the bottom of the crock and some pieces were a little petrified

trying the chai chai chai (traditional indian tea) or the tulsi tea. do not miss the hummus that they offer from greek gourmet, either.","a very cozy tea house. they stock an extensive tea selection (the menu is 60 pages long). fortunately, the staff is quite helpful and patient with the most indecisive of customers. the atmosphere is relaxing with your only worry being which delicious tea to

neighborhood).","extremely friendly and informative staff, and the beer tea is a clever, well-executed drink. the decor is clean, spacious, and minimalistic, and the tea is endlessly wonderful. rumor has it that the owner is growing tea- assam lines the windows in pots. this is a lovely little spot that i will certainly return to.","dobra tea is located at the corner of beacon st and murray ave. there is a pay parking lot nearby. i went in and noticed all the various teas. a man helped me and told me to sit anywhere. it was lunchtime and hardly anyone was there.i noticed a sign that said, \"please silence your mobile device.\" i could not understand why because i did hear folks in conversation. nevertheless, the place has a middle eastern theme to it. i was given a menu that lists all their teas. it has sections in it that are divided by type and a detailed description of each. their teas are white, black, green, asian, african, and japanese influences to name a few. in the back of the menu there were some food options. i was handed a \"bell\" by which i could summon him for what i needed.i asked about their teas and sampling some. he said they do not do samples but asked what i preferred. i settled for a plum tea and was told that a pot would be about 10 oz. i also ordered   a slice of pumpkin bread. my tea came in a small teapot along with a tiny cup to drink it from. the tea was supposed to have plum leaves in it but it tasted like plain black tea and very bland. the pumpkin bread was a very small piece but was very good. i rang my bell and asked for some honey just to give it some flavor.i noticed a man at a nearby table with a different teapot. i learned that they try to match the teapots to the type of tea you ordered. when i was done i asked my server how to pay and he told me to come to the front of the store. there they have a gift shop and of course you can buy loose tea in a bag for about $5.00 per ounce. the teapots on sale were similar to the ones served but were very pricey. i did mention to him how bland my tea was and he apologized by saying he probably did not steep it that much. meantime i looked on the counter and there were tiny cups of different types of loose tea for purchase. he told me that since they had been sitting out i would not be able to smell them but could smell any of my choice. i asked to do that with a few and learned that if i could have done this in the beginning it would have helped me choose a better tea. there was one i really liked with cinnamon in it. he sells that tea but you have to add your own cinnamon. i paid my bill and decided to leave since it was under $10.00. needless to say it was a fair visit.  i like how it is served and the atmosphere but if you are unacquainted with tea then this place would not be your best bet.","cool chill vibe in here for hanging out and working.  very large and diverse collection of tea, good coffee and their pita and hummus. usually playing excellent music with live shows in the back.  check them out at electro belly dance troupe.","dobra tea is a beautiful combination of extensive tea collection and ornate decor.i had a chinese green tea -- the first one on the list -- that was accompanied by detailed directions on how to let the leaves steep by my server. it was like a schooling on teas, and i really appreciated it. i also might have eaten an entire goat cheese, pita, olive/tomato platter all by myself. i would definitely go back. it is peaceful there and can accommodate large groups or loners like me.","dobra is a really cool place. they have regular tables, but also little cushions where you and your friends can sit comfortably around a table that is much closer to the floor. they give you a bell to ring when you want someone to some to your table, so they do not have to constantly check in (also- you get to ring a little bell for service and it is kind of fun and amusing).they have a billion different teas and a good selection of interesting snacks to eat. i highly recommend dobra if you are looking for a new and interesting place to drink your tea/do homework/play on your laptop/read/have a get together with friends.","a wonderful addition to squirrel hill. i went there a few days ago with a party of two. we had three different teas. the staff pays great attention to the details of tea making: they advised us to take a bowl instead of a pot for two of the teas because the water had to be at a particular temperature (different one for each tea) which would be difficult to do in the pot.  great choice of teas from all over asia. the space is also very friendly and comfortable. it feels very relaxing. finally, the prices are very reasonable and not at all nasty with your wallet. go there folks. make sure this

seconds.","another awesome food truck on the pittsburgh scene!  the menu for the mac & gold truck is always interesting and creative.  depending on the day though you may see more than one item you would want to try or it is possible nothing will appeal to you.  they do have a plain option (with additions like meat or veggies extra) as well as veggie options.  i partook in the chicken cordon bleu special which was very good.  the mac is very creamy and cheesy.  i thought it was a bit pricey at $11 and could have used some more chicken.  on the plus side, it more than filled me up.  leftovers heated up well. i will be keeping track of the mac & gold truck from here on out, hoping to get another taste of their cheesy offerings.","as a huge mac & cheese fan, i was very impressed with this truck! i have had a few different types of their mac & cheese and it has always been creamy and delicious. can get kind of pricey depending on the type you order or what add-ons you choose,

ingredients and specials, so you never know what you can get. they have veggie and meat add-ons so you can create your own dish if you would like. they also serve hand-cut rosemary garlic french fries

coffee on walnut. ice cream is excellent. like the other commentators, i feel the service can be hit or miss, mostly because the lack of a clear location to form a line, but it is generally excellent.

compared to all other coffee shops on walnut, it is not packed. they have great coffee, and delicious homemade cookies etc. their hot chocolate is the best. the only reason why i wouldn`t give this place a 5 star is that their tables are super tiny, and because of the size of the place, if you are a group of more than Meaning to in Short Message Service people, it is very hard to sit at the same table altogether. great place to hang out while waiting for your table at pamela`s, especially when the weather is nice and you can grab a coffee and sit outside!","a great little neighborhood coffee that is located two blocks from my new place in shadyside. i am pretty sure that this place may quickly become my new place to work, and i am surprised that i never discovered this place the last time i lived in the neighborhood. the people who work here are really nice, and what i love about this place is that most people who come in are regulars. the staff know almost every patron by name (which again speaks highly of the staff). the venue is cute and homey right at the end of the walnut street stores. a part of me wishes it was a bit bigger, but i think it would probably lose a lot of its charm if it was built up like the coffee tree roasters across the street. one minor setback i have here is that you have to walk a ways through the building to get to the bathroom, which is a little on the gross side (however the bathroom is for the entire building, so this is probably more of a reflection on the other businesses here as much as for jitters).  anyways, the coffee here is good, and you get your second cup for free! i look forward to becoming one of the regulars here.","a lot of people who come here are regulars, and for good reason. the baristas are super friendly, and they really take the time to get to know you. they serve high quality coffee at a fair price, with excellent espresso, and talented baristas. they also have dave & andy is ice cream available, which is

there is nothing to dislike about this place besides the lack of samples. variety, freshness, and quality are all two thumbs up!","although i wish i was 100% italian, sadly i am not.  i am only 50%.  i blame the other 50% for my shortcomings in the kitchen.  therefor, the beauty and magic of penn mac is 50% lost on me.  but i still think it is 100% awesome.  that was my math lesson for the day!you could really spend days in here looking over all the different cheeses, pasta sauces, etc.  the \"prepared\" food section is the best part for me.  there is probably hundreds of different kinds of ravioli, tortellini and spaghetti noodles.  it seriously amazing!  there is no need to think about it, just grab the one with ingredients you like, on a recent trip this was mushroom stuffed tortellini, then grab a sauce.  you do not have to walk far to wander into the sauce section, which again, houses so many sauces you could swim over to italy in all of them!  i chose the pesto and garlic sauce to pair with my tortellini.  the service was friendly, especially for a lost looking soul like me.  i did not know which pasta to pick and they helped me.  i dropped half my purchases on the floor, a staff member helped me scoop them up.  good enough for me!the dinner i made from penn mac = 100% awesome!","a must-see in pittsburgh. as a west coast dude, i do not get to see many places like this. justir shipping operation is also exceptional.","hands down the best cheese selection!

they have buckets and buckets of bulk olives you can choose from-stuffed olives and plain. they have a bread section with breadworks items and several vats of olive oil so you can buy a large amount. there is a small section stocked with fresh produce in the back near the registers. they have a whole section, as well, dedicated to all types of spices-the smells are intoxicating! this is my personal favorite stop when i go to the strip district and i highly recommend anyone who likes  food (and who does not?!) to pop in and enjoy!","considering i left a job in the strip district a few months ago, it is quite unfortunate that i just tried penn mac out recently.  this place is usually pretty crowded, but it is only because the food quality is soor to actually going myself, i had sampled a few cheese from here.  all of them were delicious.  i also came here occasionally to buy things for work, which led to some exceptionally interesting purchases, none of which were edible.  but i finally decided to pick up some frozen pasta for quick meals after class.  after sifting through a bunch of raviolis, including lobster and crab, i finally settled on the cheese manicotti ($7.Parent is watchingParent is watching).  the package contained 8 tubes, which seemed like a steal.  the manicotti are delicious and only take Meaning to in Short Message Service0 minutes in the oven!  super convenient for after work or people that work here are nice, and they take credit cards!  a win in my book.","best deli in the city.  it is not a tasting shop, but if you go during off-peak hours and ask to try a bunch of things, they are more than willing to make your day brighter.  great selection of random italian dry goods.  worth a trip, although avoid weekend afternoons if you are adverse to crowds.","a required stop on every visit to the strip. best selection of pasta, cheeses and meats. try the antipasto salad at the olive bar. it is the best!","dudes and dudettes, this place is amazing. they have got cheese, pepperoni and prosciutto coming out their ears. fresh pasta, homemade pasta sauce and olive oil from the barrel for the taking. they have got frozen dough, pepperoni slices and shredded cheese all next together if you want to bake your own pizzas. when they are not busy go to the deli and find the perfect compliment to whatever wine you have been needing an excuse to drink. the people that work there are the nicest folk that clearly love their jobs. most of them love that i do not know the first thing about anything italian because it gives them a chance to share what it is they specialize in. goods are cheap, fresh and of the highest quality. i hope i am able to find something similar when i move soon. one of the top 10 reasons i have enjoyed my time in pittsburgh."]},"Pittsburgh Winery":{"name":"Pittsburgh Winery","longitude":"-79.975468","latitude":"40.457335","reviews":["even though the music was only ok, the wine was great and the whole setup of the venue was nice and cozy. i enjoyed my only visit, but next time i will hope for better musical acts.","alright let is be honest, a winery in pittsburgh has any wine liver a little worried. pittsburgh is not typically known for its wine. i went in with a little bit of fear but i was ready to give it a try. first the place is really cool- kinda like a dungeon!

 my hubby and i shared a carnivore pizza (sorry lenten friday. i had already cheated in the morning, so i went along with it the whole day).  i must say that the pizza was delish, but the toppings were spread out unevenly so some slices have more meat and others just have cheese.  for dessert, my hubby and i shared the emily is chocolate cake? it was just ok.  my hubby was disappointed because he thought it was a real chocolate cake and the presentation did not help either.  it was a dense flourless chocolate cake, super rich with a berry sauce.  our friends got the bread pudding and the toasted almond dessert, which both looked good and the presentation on the almond dessert was drinks, my hubby had a stilleto, which is usually a drink he enjoys but the fruit juice they used and whatever else in the mix ruined it for him bc the stilleto he is used to is only makers mark and amaretto.  he is a big whisky drinker.  i had their cider, which i enjoyed bettter than an angry orchard.  it tasted more crisp and less sweet. they have a great variety of beers on tap, but the one thing the birthday boy wanted, they ran out off. oopsies!  the server did make another recommendation, and she was pleasant and attentive to our table.  this place looks bigger on the outside, but it was really small and crowded inside that there is barely a walkway.  we had one of the two big tables in the back for larger groups, but i can see how the smaller tables in the front can have no privacy bc you are soclose to others and anyone walking the aisle would have to walk in single file.  i ca not imagine having the seats by the aisle always having to be conscious about moving the seat to make way for diners.  not a lot of room to move.  the decor was very nice and appropriate.  i love the use of mason jars for decor and drinks.  they also have a nice size of a bar with other off putting issue is that my friend said when she made reservations that they had a list of random and strange rules some are understandable like everyone in the party must be present before being seated but there was a Meaning to in Short Message Service hr time limit for the table.  luckily, it is winter and in negative wind chill, so they were not too busy.  we did only stay for Meaning to in Short Message Service hrs anyway.  i definitely recommend this place for food and drinks, but not for claustrophobics and parties bigger than 8 otherwise definitely make that reservation.","food is decent, but i think it is a little over-priced. could use more variety/vegetarian options. but what they do have is pretty good. but when i am downtown, there are better places i would rather eat."]},"Salud Juicery":{"name":"Salud Juicery","longitude":"-79.9345853","latitude":"40.4512017","reviews":["awesome place with tons of options. personal favorites: kevlar press coffee and green-ana smoothie. kombucha on tap is good, but a little pricey.","amazing juice, better smoothies!

side streets in shadyside if you are just popping in. the desserts- scones, cookies, and cake/cheesecake- are all very good, and the paninis are pretty good if overpriced. the people who work here have always been good, quick, and very nice. it is also a great place to people watch (yes, i will admit it), as a plethora of people come in and out with high turnover, and it is great to see people

small enough anymore. plus cm only offers soy as a milk replacement which is atrocious in this day and age. the bloomfield starbucks is much more conveniently located, and it has somehow managed to make its way into my heart despite my preference for small local coffee shops. i think the wonderful saturday morning staff at this location have a lot to do  with that, as well as the fact that they

if you are not already in the vicinity. the store itself is nice, and i like that they are one of the few locations that still seems to have the verismo pods for sale, but it is layout is weird due to the space being long and narrow. when you are waiting for your drink, you feel like you are intruding on peoples conversations at the tables in the front of the store. then after standing in their space waiting for your drink, you are forced to walk around them to grab napkins, etc. and exit the store...and those tables always have people sitting in them, so it is nearly staff are typically really nice, though, and while i have personally never had any issues with my drinks - i literally only drink refreshers and frappuccinos...easy enough, right? -  my wife will often complain about inconsistency with her macchiato. i would value her opinion on consistency more than mine since i think most people are there for a hot coffee other issue with this location is not even necessarily their fault. the parking lot happens to be shared with whole foods, and when you are trying to maneuver through the lot or find a parking space...well...let is just say it epitomizes that \"whole

it is pretty standard. the location is great and the building is super cute. the staff is always really friendly and familiar. i never have to wait very long in line either, even on busy weed at

at upmc, it is usually not for something good.  i was here because a family member was at the er.  having access to a full service starbucks, complete with seating is an oasis!   it allows people to come get some comfort food or just a quick caffeine fix and relax for a few minutes.  the seating area is nice and off set from the hospital (helps you forget that you are in a hospital).  staff was very friendly and helpful.  this starbucks provided me a nice break. .or distraction . .from a very bad day.  great idea starbucks and umpc!","delicious, always fast. this was my favorite starbucks downtown (before oxford centre opened). the baristas are great and the manager runs a tight ship. it is located in the omni william penn lobby, but i always enter through the street doors.","all of

breakfast pastries and sandwiches, little salads and snacks, and a wall of retail. be warned, though, that this location commonly does not participate in regular starbucks promotions.","great starbucks shop. the crew knows their stuff. always good and fast. become a regular and they will start your drink when you walk in the door without asking.","great starbucks and service is really fast and it is good. my coffee comes out asap.","a good starbucks.  there is always a line at this one due to it is location but they do a great job of getting people served quickly.  today i had a salted camel mocha.  it was prettys location also has a fireplace which is a nice touch for cold days.","fact: working with people who have not had coffee is thet: college students are thet: despite dealing with these two types of people the employees at this location are unfailingly cheerful and polite and helpful and i have absolutely no idea what kind of drugs are in the water to make it so.","as busy as this starbucks gets they always treat you special. like special in a good way. not in a \"special\" way. ya dig?","first off the picture that is posted is of the wrong starbucks.  i have worked in the building where this starbucks is located for a while now.  i have to say it is the most consistent starbucks that i have been to period.  the staff is always friendly, and fast!  this is very important especially for this location; it gets extremely busy during peak hours.  the other day they accidentally put my drink in wrong.  they gave me a free drink coupon just because i waited an extra minute - i did not even complain!  now that is service.","a basic starbucks. nothing too flashy, but it is always clean and the baristas are friendly. it is usually totally packed so it is pretty noisy, but the line moves fast. great location.","as far as starbucks goes, the southside location is currently my favorite...and i am not just saying that because it is the most convenient location for me. there are a lot of gripes about parking, but i have rarely had any issue finding a spot when we actually drive there instead of walking. granted, i mostly go in the middle of the day, service has always been great! the employees all greet you with a smile, and seem to have a good attitude. also, do not be afraid of the lines...the service is quick, even when there is only two people behind the counter!the final compliment i have is the consistency of the drinks. as far as my drinks go, it is one of the few starbucks that seems to deliver the same quality every time."]},"Delicious Raw":{"name":"Delicious Raw","longitude":"-80.0009351","latitude":"40.4401244","reviews":["great smoothie and great customer service. very friendly and they even gave me free

have too many juice/smoothie cafes around town. at first when i heard they were owned by eatn park i was a little hesitant to try them. i do not exactly think of healthy food when i think of eatn park. i would say their food is down right awful, you could not pay me to eat there (but that is a whole other review). but in spite of that i wanted to give delicious raw a fair shot. looking at their menu they have a lot of juice & smoothie choices & most of the drink combinations they have come up with i have not seen at other juice bars. which is a plus in my book, i always love trying something new. i ordered the pink pleasure & my husband ordered the florida glow. both drinks were delicious! all the different flavors of all the different fruits & veggies combined perfectly together. you could taste everything equally, not one flavor over powered the whole drink. they also sell fruit bowls which i will try next time & raw granola bars. i did try one of the granola bars & it was very good. the prices are pretty much the same that you will find at any other juice bar, about $7-8 per drink. i am not crazy about the location being downtown b/c it is always a pain to find parking & plus the fact that you have to pay so much to park downtown. but maybe if this location goes over well they will open more around the city. delicious raw is a must try! i ca not wait to go back to try some more juices.","after spending a summer in new york city with smoothie and juice shops on every corner i was excited to come back and start my mornings off with a smoothie from delicious raw. this is my third time trying their smoothies and i have been fairly disappointed each time. i have tried three different ones hoping it was just the flavor i did not like. but now i am kind of wondering if they even try the smoothies before they put them on the menu. i am hoping and praying a liquiteria opens in pittsburgh sometime soon."]},"Tazza D'oro Cafe & Espresso

market.  would definitely recommend for buying fish to go, or sitting for a meal. located in the busy strip district of pittsburgh with lots of shopping opportunity. definitely worth stopping here during a day out!","great sushi in pittsburgh? you will find it here at penn ave. my girl rachel c knows her stuff when it comes to seafood. i was a little skeptical about getting sushi this far away from the ocean, but her enthusiasm and familiarity with the spot put my mind at ease and i followed her lead. i am so glad i did. the space is fun and funky -- a casual fish market and restaurant in one. it was a busy day when we were there so it took a bit to place our order at the counter and get our food, but once we did i was most definitely happy and impressed. the rolls are unique and playful, and there is definitely something for everyone. seating is, as i mentioned, very casual and dispersed throughout the space, which is on the louder, more cavernous side as an homage to their fish market days. the building seemed to be under a bit of construction while i was there, so things were a bit disheveled and the restrooms were quite frightening -- filthy and  wreaking of fish. other than that, i would hit this place up again anytime.","had the baja cod wrap.  fresh, delicious, reasonable prices, great music, hip atmosphere, friendly service.  what else can one ask for?","coming from nyc and being a seafood lover, this place is the realually had one of the best fish wraps i have ever had. the cod is lightly battered, moist, and flaky. i was delighted to see that sriracha was part of the sauce, but it was so sparingly used that i did not taste it. the tartar/cream sauce used was mild, not too tangy, andfriend got the mussels in tomato basil sauce, and it was amazing. it was served with toasted and buttered ciabatta, which he used to soak up the delicious sauce.we also ordered oysters on the half shell which were decent, but i have had better in nyc. they were still refreshing and did their job.so far, this is my favorite place in pittsburgh. on top of the great food, the prices are even better!!!","delicious and fresh! we tried the crab tacos and spicy tuna melt. both were incredibly yummy. the tuna melt was spicy with the jalapenos and siracha and i think we both broke a sweat on a bite or two, but overall excellent. the crab tacos were our favorite and the bean and rice salad served with the sandwich was fabulous. we also had a pretty girl sushi roll which was very fresh and tasty too. overall, we enjoyed our selections and would go back in a heat beat.","excellent food, try the copper salmon.","checked this place out today after hearing good things on urbanspoon and enjoyed the food immensely.i got the crab tacos and thought they were pretty good. the crab was kind of underwhelmed with everything else but the cabbage was crisp and flavorful and the tomatoes had this deep red color to them and tasted really good (i usually do not like tomatoes). the srircha sauce that it advertised was actually a mixture of the sauce with sour cream. i think it went well with the tacos. i also got a bowl of clam chowder soup that was very tasty. the stock was thinner than i am use to but still as flavorful. it was a little light on clams, though and had a lot of potato.i am definitely bringing my mom and dad to this place the next time they come down. they both enjoy seafood, especially the way it is prepared at penn avenue. they also love sushi and will probably be happy to see that predominately on their menu.","greatest

then when you are all done you go up and tell them what you had . . . kind of an honor system (which i am not sure would work in nyc).  anyway, the food was simple but very good.  i had a lobster

allows the outside wall space to free up for a greater selection. this is primarily a wine rather than a liquor store, with a medium sized domestic and international selection and supplemented with a fairly large chairman is selection. for those who are not familiar with chairman is selections, these are [usually domestic] wines that have been purchased by the state in large quantities due to discontinuation and are being pushed through the sales channel. they are fantastically priced for a good quality trade off. however, this store does hold it is own in liquor. while they are do not hold a overstock of different, smaller liquors outside of the mainstream diageo staples, this location deliberately makes a point of pushing the seasonal and new liquors to the pa market.

owner, scott, is into. his motto \"buy a good friend a good beer\" is everywhere and really speaks to his passion for bringing a quality product to his friends - in this case, pittsburgh. the reviewers before me have mentioned the hidden warehouse that east end operates from, and they are right. it is tucked away. but, once you find it you feel special, like you have uncovered a gem. i sort of think that is kind of the point ... once you have tried an east end beer, you are part of the club. the inner circle. the family.i have heard scott speak about his beer, and i love hearing about his process. he makes \"session beers,\" which means that in addition to his standard selection (monkey boy, big hop and the like), you can find a new beer at east end almost every week. he tries new things all the time, and makes what he likes, and let me tell you, what he likes is delicious.if you ca not head to the east end to try some east end, you will be glad to know that this beer is found in bars all over the city, and you can fill a growler at the pittsburgh public market. if you head there, or to the brewhouse, bring cash and a smile. you wo not be disappointed.","growler fills and kegs only at this current location.  very small bar and retail area; really only room for a few people to stand.  the guy working there was really nice and allowed us to sample each of these guys are brewing some of the best beer in pittsburgh, and i am sure they will keep gaining popularity.","east end, the beerstand in the pittsburgh public market is a fun place to fill up growlers and meet friends. have a beer, eat tacos from la palapa- a match made in heaven.","check out their growler hours and you can do beer tasting for free! i really like their big hop ipa and their english pale ale...which i can rarely find brewed anywhere.","buy a good friend a good beer. that is their motto and it fits perfectly!the atmosphere in the brewery is super laid back and inviting. come, join us, sample some beer, chat about beer, chat about life, fill up your growler and enjoy your beer at home! simple plan, but it is owner, scott is obviously super knowledgeable about beer, and i love that. have you ever tried sour beer before? i would never heard about it. the thought kinda grossed me out actually, but come to think of it, i love sour gummy worms, so what the heck! and you know what? i loved it! they also have around 10 rotating taps at the brewery. i would have to say my fave is the fat gary nut brown ale that i would had at local restaurants and events. but after visiting, i am digging the monkey girl (a play on the regular monkey boy), a light seasonal wheat beer. if you have ever had their beer around tahn, you have gotta stop in to see the real deal! if you have never had their beer round tahn, you gotta stop in for a taste! what are you waiting for?!","hello awesome beer!east end is the ish. i only wish it had an area to hang out and enjoy a beverage or two. the keg bike ride they do each year is an awesome way to deliver the seasonal beers to local bars and has become a very populare how low key it is. you have to check it outcheck out the growler hours in the strip. love it!","great brews. great people.i visit the east end brewing company stand in the public market at the strip every couple weeks. i am always greeted with a high five and more samples than i can handle on a saturday at noon. they are more than happy to let you try all of the rotating taps and you can tell they are passionate about their price can be a bit high but, for a craft beer, it is totally worth it. recycle the growlers and save yourself a few bucks each time. i highly recommend stopping by and trying some of the delicious rotating beers at east end.","first of all, this is absolutely the best beer brewed in pennsylvania. i would venture out farther, but dogfish head is close enough at our 5 oclock to give eebc a run for their money. there is nothing not to like. the prices are great. the beer is fantastic. it is local. the guys who own/run the joint are normal people. they have a few very good standby is and they are small enough to be nimble and do things like a kvass. this are just a few of the good ones. -big hop harvest -- i literally shed a tear when their last keg kicked. -snow melt -- winter warmer deluxe.-big hop -- this and dale is are the two parts of my regulars section is for my hopes and dreams. coming soon is a steelcut oatmeal stout that was once described as steelcut oatmeal/black ipa. this made me excited. i was disappointed to find that the black ipa was dropped from the description, however i am still looking forward to drinking that oatmeal stout with pleasure. please, east end, give us a black ipa. make our beeriest dreams come true.","beer. brewed in plain warehouse in an otherwise unremarkable location. generous tastings in what i am assuming the lobby is heaven will look like. oh, and the aforementioned beers? they are real, and they are spectacular.if i could give this place 8 stars i would jump at the opportunity. the beers are crafted with care - all unique brews with qualities unlike their competitors. as one patron said this evening about the big hop: \"it is like sierra nevada, only it is better than sierra nevada.\" no matter what your preference is, there is certain to be a beer for your palate and an opportunity to taste each tap to discover your passion. and, if nothing else, there is certain to be quality conversation in the lobby. rumor has it that things get pretty busy there on the weekends - i ca not wait to join the party!","great beer being made by great.","checking out the pitt beer week beers. oh and try the root beer too!","beer and more beer! glorious beer in big shiny vats and dripping from taps! session beers offer great variety from what you can buy @ your local watering hole. truly bare bones - just a cold dank beer tasting counter w a friendly knowledgable beer dude. we walked back to see the beer creation happening and it was surprising how small it all looked when you consider how many bars serve eebc beers. i think the only batbroom here is in the alley!

not supposed to be a 1-1 cheese to bagel ratio.  but the lady at the counter was super nice.  she said something awesome the last time i was there - like \"have a peaceful day\" or \"have a beautiful

austin? instead, i will limit myself on reviewing the ever so friendly staff and parking lot. first, the employees. i have been to several whole foods around the country and i always got the impression that whole foods prides itself on customer service. maybe this place is the exception? i was shopping here yesterday and a lady kindly asked an employee if she could squeeze in behind his veggie cart to grab something. the employee actually had the audacity to say, \"when i am done\". and he did just that. he finished stocking his fruits and veggies and when he moved his cart and the lady thanked him, he did not say a word. also, the lady bagging my groceries did not say one word to me. not when i said hello. not when i said thank you. not even an \"ok\" when i said have a nice day. she did not even smile at me! where is the love? actually, where are your manners?  i do not need you to love me, but do not be rude or ignore me. second, the parking lot. i am pretty sure this is the only whole foods in all of pittsburgh. however, the parking lot seems to be built for pittsburgh, population: 50. it is a small lot - good luck finding a spot without creepily following someone to their car and fighting an suv for the spot. luckily, i have never truly had a problem parking because i go at off times and park farther away. but i am suspecting one of these days i will come out and find my car dented or scratched. maybe by a car, maybe by a shopping cart......maybe by the lady who was bagging my groceries yesterday....so two stars docked for the above mentioned.  other than that, i will keep shopping here - after all, it is not like i have another choice when it comes to the whole foods of pittsburgh.","food poisoning a la tomato bisqueevert is too bad, i do not mind

weeks in a row, and i have no intention of stopping. was it the charming little girl who greeted me at the door exclaiming \"wow! you are tall!\" (i am all of 55 on a good day)? was it the smorgasbord of taste-testing options for the infused olive oils and vinegars they feature? or was it the incredible comforting scent of freshly baked goodies from la gourmandine on saturday? whatever keeps drawing me there, will likely be a treat for you, too. i bought a lovely basil olive oil that is my new favorite ingredient to top off the perfect caprese salad. i bought a croissant that challenges just about any croissant i have had in all of my world travels. a few minutes in the oven turned this croissant into a fluffy, flaky and buttery perfection that only could be improved with a (ahem) \"dollop\" of nutella. this alone, should make you run to check this place out. lastly, the owner has wonderful suggestions and ideas for your next culinary adventure. i appreciate her recommendations and value her input. her suggestion of making a grilled cheese using one of the oils and the ciabatta bread that i bought was a delicious, quick dinner on a busy night for me this week. community

late. and their cookie dough bites seem to better than others....","i absolutely love razzy fresh. they have a great selection of yogurt flavors, some of which rotate regularly. there are the traditional flavors (vanilla, chocolate), but also fruity flavors and indulgent flavors (e.g. cake batter). there are also non-fat options, if you swing that topping selection is also sure to please, with several different fruit options, as well as many sweet options. my personal favorite offering is the chocolate chip cookie dough (cccd), which is the best cccd i have had as an ice cream topping. usually cccd toppings suck because they are clearly made with crap to replace the eggs. razzy fresh is cccd tastes just like it was sliced off of a cookie dough log. mmmmmmm.","great variety of flavors as well as toppings. this is the only frozen yogurt place i have been to, and it is amazing. i would feel like i am cheating on them if i went anywhere else.","how can i forget about passion

of cookie, cake, all-the-good-stuff options, with a decent ratio of one to the other.  the real deal here compared to others is the actual yogurt.  creamy and dense, even refreshing if you go with the tart.  +1 does not even get toppings on his vanilla. i know, i already told him that is the wholein tart with kiwi and those little fruit pop bubbles (what the heck are those called?) is my go to, but i spoil myself at this spot with the triple chocolate and the severely underrated salted caramel pretzel. where you gonna get salted caramel pretzel fro-yo?! here. until midnight. way too often.  top that heaven with fruity pebbles, mochi, oreos, coconut, and then get the insulin shots ready.  most shops are terribly similar; fro-yo is typically fro-yo no matter where you are.  but the awesome hours here without lack of seating make it definitely the most convenient, and the staff is actually nice to you.  i know sometimes i get worried about how much my masterpieces weigh, but our two

get to it. while their froyo is definitely delicious, the shop itself has never really screamed \"come back to me!\"for starters, delicious froyo or not, the actual selection of flavors kind of pales in comparison to what i have found in other shops over the years; this place sticks to standard flavors only. additionally, i always notice that toppings have fallen into other containers throughout the day. while this is usually not a big problem for flexible ol me, i admittedly worry about anyone who may be coming in with allergies when i see this. i definitely recommend asking for fresh toppings if you have a severe allergy, just to beitionally, while in other shops the staff say hello and offer right away to give you samples of froyo or answer any questions you may have, i do not think i have ever exchanged a word with the staff here about anything other than how much my froyo costs. you just walk in, get your yogurt, and then just leave after paying, unless you want to sit at one of the tables scattered throughout the store. and many times when doing this my friends and i have had to throw away leftover napkins and clean the tables ourselves...sorry, but delicious frozen

of those types, and are usually playing music conducive to productivity, which i could certainly use.","commonplace serves my favorite coffee in pittsburgh.  they have a great and changing rotation of coffees and teas and it is clear they care deeply about the business and art of coffee-brewing.  they really take their time with the brewing process, run a very clean shop, and are super-informed about all of their menu options.  they will warn you that the larger cappuccino size has four (four!) shots of espresso, but holy jesus, it is worth it. the baristas are always polite, but it is not a

 it is served from noon to four daily, which is nice for a \"ladies who lunch afternoon\" or a saturday or sunday outing for mom.  it is in a parlor, which is small but charming.  there is also an outdoor patio that would be nice if it is not too hot out (drinking hot tea in 80 degrees is not too appealing).  there is a full high tea service for $Meaning to in Short Message Service0 per person, which seems a little steep, but for tea service is not too bad.  there is also other combo is for around $1Meaning to in Short Message Service, but i would say go big or go home!the tea menu is very large and there were tons of choices. they give you the main choices between black, green and herbal, but you can also blend them together too.  i chose the caramel vanilla, which i guess is being taken off the menu sadly.  it was delish though... so maybe they will bring it back at some point.  there were honestly a lot of different ones i would have been more than happy with too!the one thing i think is very cool and very different is that they offer you a different tea selections with the different tiers of food.  i have never heard of them doing that before.  usually you get one tea choice and that is it.  i love that you can pair the foods together with different teas for no up-charge.  very unique and a definite perk of coming here.  i have been to several high tea services and this one would definitely be on the light side.  the portions were small, but surprisingly filled me up for the entire afternoon until a later dinner.  i mean, it is tea service, not a five course meal!  there was a chicken and egg salad sandwich and a mushroom and cream cheese on a crisp baguette.  the winner was absolutely the mushroom and cream cheese choice.  it was amazing and i definitely could have eaten ten of those!  there were two scone choices of blueberry/peach and lemon/lemon ginger.  those were actually surprisingly tiny.  i thought they were both moist and fresh, but i would have loved them to be a bit bigger because they were so good and i love to slather clotted cream on them!   oh, and there was also fresh fruit.  which is great and all, but more scone please!the last tier was the desserts.  forgive me for not being accurate enough, but there was a delicious chocolate piece, cheesecake with lemon curd and blueberries.  loved the chocolate, but i like my cheesecake plain.  while it was good it was not life changing.  but, the coconut macaroon was honestly thee best macaroon i had ever had.  again, ten of those in my possession would have been scarfed down in like 5 seconds.  i would buy a batch of those if i could!  seriously, can i??i ca not wait to bring my mom here, total mom place fo sho!  but i also love it for myself too!  or for a bridal shower... if i could do another one (since i am married i do not think that is proper).  but it is a great place, that is what i am trying to say and i will for sure be back to get my proper english lady on!","five stars!!!!

 considering the sandwich was so good the pasta salad that came with it did not hold a candle to it.  pretty bland and i left half eaten.  i ordered the chocolate mousse for dessert, considering the dessert case looked so inviting!  it fell flat as well.  do you remember those ice creams that you got in the elementary school cafeteria that came between the cardboard?  it kinda tasted like that.  the only thing that made it was the cherries and sauce that adorned it.  that made it!  i would not order it again though.  i will stick to carton ice cream!surprised i still gave it Short for for in Short Message Service stars?  me too!  but it earned it with the setting, friendly service and dream inducing chicken sandwich!

(many veggies are grown right on campus.) desserts included a cherry-cranberry-walnut cake with caramel ice cream and a yellow almond-based cake with not-too-sweet chocolate icing. interesting flavor combinations, a constantly-changing menu, sensible portions, attentive service, and personal attention from the host keep us coming back. members get 10% off and can reserve in advance of the day. parking is free."]},"Espresso A Mano":{"name":"Espresso A Mano","longitude":"-79.9650015","latitude":"40.4657718","reviews":["a garage door cafe in pittsburgh?  wow, things are starting to look up around here.  it is a little awkward since the vibe is definitely regular customers who are here to do work with headphones in their ears.  all in all, it is a great little urban cafe.","fantastic place to get some work done with the free wifi. dropped in because i am a big fan of coffee. in general, this is a great place for it. they have your basic set of drinks, including espresso, mocha, iced coffee, americano, and the such. they also have some baked pastries, sandwiches, fridge drinks, and coffee bean bags if you are interested in that. i ended up getting a mocha and i have to admit ... their coffee game is so on point. taste was fantastic, not too heavy, just right. i also ended up getting one of their ham & prosciutto sandwiches, which was delicious (meat used tasted great and melted cheese = love). great place to meet up with friends, esp. in the summer when they have that garage door pulled up. the ideal place for a meet up. i will return.","i am a pretty standard guy when it comes to coffee. regular black coffee, americano, and cold brew are my drinks and espresso a mano does a great job, and at a decent price.","a coffee joint for caffeine  connaisseurs on  uber-trendy/gentrifying butler street/lawrenceville(or excuse me- \"lola\" for lower l-ville.  ughhh).good drip coffee. good pour-over assuming you want to pay double, per be fairly scene-y and \"look how hipster i am.\" -ywould be nice if not so many of the patrons were glued to their laptops and devices . why not just stay at home to do that ??~!!i love the bathroom !  spacious !nice during warm  weather when they  open  the garagee the mahi taco/wrap food truck that sometimes, parks in front ... on the weekends, you see a lot of edward & muffy trust-funded types walking the poodle along front but, adds to the people watching melee` .","by far some of the best coffee i have had in all my travels. go in for an iced coffee, sit down and enjoy the open garage door on a nice spring pittsburgh afternoon. all the baristas are awesome and it is in one of the best neighborhoods in pittsburgh, lawrenceville.","50 reviews.

a caramelized exterior and a soft, warm interior. i got a waffle with biscoff and whipped cream - both of which slowly melted into the crevices (and into my heart!) seeing as this was the first time i would ever had biscoff spread, i was instantly hooked. to this day, i go to waffallonia on a regular basis just to buy a jar of they setback is that it is really tiny with very few seats. then again,

very busy, but staff was on the ball and kept things moving quickly. worth your time. be sure to try maple bacon!","homophobic donuts leave a bad taste in my mouth- no thanks. if you want a luscious, apolitical treat, there are plenty of excellent bakeries on the strip that actually do promote peace and love.","fair price for the quality of what you get. the bacon maple is by far my favorite but i tired a bunch of other flavors today all very very good.","cake donuts! my fav kind of donuts!so there really is not anything particularly spectacular or unique about these donuts.  all the donuts are the same plain cake donut flavor, with different toppings or icing.  i would not really splurge for the premium toppings, unless there is a specific flavor that calls to you.  otherwise, all the donuts tasted pretty much thet being said, i would still give them Short for for in Short Message Service stars because the donuts are made fresh in front of you...and boy does that donut smell really get you as you wander around smallman st!  the donuts are also my preferred type: cakey and dense!  they also kept really well for more than a week.  they did not taste stale or hard after being refrigerated!so if you are in the area and want a coffee and some donuts, definitely stop by peace, love and little donuts.  really, they are little.","fresh made donuts right before your eyes.  the little mechanism that churns them out is pretty cool. while they are not as fluffy as i would like, they are still pretty good. they can be topped in a lot of different ways, with varous glazes and and away the best one is the maple glaze topped with bacon.  the prices for donuts of this quality is pretty reasonable, and the staff are pretty efficient at making donuts and moving people in and out, without rushing you.  that is good, because there are a lot oftom line:  i am not sure why everyone is so bent out of shape on politics, plain and simple: this place makes tasty donuts. and that is all you need to know.","do they buy packaged donuts from giant eagle and throw some different toppings? might as well. those would taste better than here. i love donuts. i do not understand how the service here is worse than the sister store in oakland. awful.","got the banana split doughnuts today, and they were delicious!  i do not give a crap about a person is politics, whether i agree with his or her opinions or not, while i am eating doughnuts.  maybe the world would be a bit more peaceful if we would all just shut up, eat a doughnut, and agree to disagree.","came here on a sunday after eating a delicious brunch at kaya. i ordered four donuts- oreo, raspberry lemonade, maple bacon and cinnamon bun. they were adorable and super tasty. i was surprised with how dense they were- definitely not a light donut, even for being so small. my favorite one had to be the raspberry lemonade donut- so summery and full of flavor. the cinnamon one was delicious too. my boyf had the oreo one and loved it. i do have to admit, the maple bacon was not one that i would ever get again. it is not that there was anything wrong with the donut at all- i just did not enjoy the cold bacon on a dense cold donut; it was a little odd. service was great and very friendly when we visited as well. i would definitely come back- got to get my basic white girl on and see if they have pumpkin spice for fall!","adorable little shop in the strip district. can smell the aroma of fresh donuts wafting out as you walk past. when you enter, you can watch the employees making fresh donuts. while it is a tight squeeze even with just five people in the shop, it is worth the loss of personal space. they have two registers, a plethora of options (maple bacon, cookie dough, samoa, birthday cake, m&m), and kind faces that are ready to help you make a decision. my dad and i ordered a dozen. definitely better eaten fresh and will harden pretty quickly if not stored properly. we do not make it down here often, but when we do, we like to stock up!","good donuts, high high high prices, bad politics.   wo not get my $ again!","edit in response to comment: krispy kreme donut shops allow to you watch the entire process through the production window from start (dough) to finish (go), which includes hygienically placing your donuts into a box via gloves and food-safe tissue.","cinnamon sugar is usually my huckleberry...but maple bacon is like what i want my best breakfast bite to taste like. quick too.","cute little place - i was glad there was a door on the other side to walk out! it is much smaller than i thought it was. the smell coming out of there was delicious. i had two small donuts that satisfied my sweet tooth. i asked for coffee, but apparently the coffee machine was broken. i would have appreciated some recommendations on where else i could get a cup of good coffee. i also felt pretty rushed when trying to order and pay..not to say i stood there attempting to decide.","* new rating = 1 star due to the hypocrisy. if you are not in the know read more - original rating = 5 stars for great donutsupon first glance you might think peace love and little donuts is just a tiny shop off the main strip. not so. this place is *amazing*. first timers receive a complimentary donut. these four bite size treats are heavy on toppings like:  oreo, coconut, jimmies, chocolate morsels, cereal toppings and just about anything else that you can dream-up to cure your sweet tooth. the shop does not appear to sell espresso so be sure to purchase milk and bring cash. i would estimate Meaning to in Short Message Service little donuts = 1 chain size donut. yum!","heard about this place from a friend and decided to go try it out. maybe the best decision of my life, i am a donut person and these are amazing donuts!go try peace love and little donuts... now!!","every donut i have tried here is delicious! the bacon was surprisingly good!! i really enjoyed the oreo and m and m. the donuts are always very fresh!","hands down, the best donuts i have had. this is a big deal for me to say. the reason why is i have lives for years in the coast of nc. anyone familiar with carolina beach knows of a state famous joint called britt is donuts. for me to say this place is better is not only a big deal but it is me turning my back on my beloved home state.","a quick stop in during a visit to the strip left me impressed. i tried two types of donuts and they were very tasty! minus one star for value, for the price you can get a larger

(big dog in the south side still takes the cake in my book. they brew intelligentsia.) the service was prompt and friendly. i love the layout and location of mm. it was a warm, sunny morning. there were not too many empty tables in the caf area, but it was not crowded or noisy. if i find myself in the strip district for a quick breakfast, brunch, or lunch, i would give mm serious consideration.","i always try to give places a second chance, and i am pleased to say that it paid off. i returned to marty is market for brunch today. my friend and i were promptly seated. i barely had time to recall the last visit issues when a server came to check on what i would like to eat. she was awesome. i did not wait for anything. food was delicious and served promptly. coffee came with free refills, and the tab was extremely reasonable. go marty is!!! you made my morning. now i have a new favorite brunch location. i recommend it to everyone.","a couple of great things to check out

and coffee bar with stools on the outside of the building.  i was not sure what to order, so asked for advice on whether i should order the pulled pork sandwich or the blt.  ended up with the pulled pork, and was very pleased.  the sandwich was constructed on chibatta bread with pickles, cheese, and a sweet tomato based bbq sauce.  homemade chips on the pickles seemed to be homemade and were delicious.  the cheese (ca not recall which type) but really stood out without over powering the rest.  the pork was tender, and the bbq sauce was very good.  the chips were okay, not myh all the hard surfaces in the store, it was relatively quite mostly because most tables were filled with one or two people and there were not large groups.  the place needs some light dining/shopping music.i really want a good pulled pork sandwich or any bbq in this city with a good carolina vinegar based bbq sauce instead of the tomato based.  i like union pig and chicken is vinegar, but can get much better.","great location in the strip, great ambience. slow service, by rushed staff. long wait for food. soggy flavorless chopped salad, burnt home fries, over cooked eggs, and bacon that seemed to

doubt, my friend and i had our last visit to marty is today.  let me first say that the food is limited but tasty. after that, nothing is consistently good...even for regulars. coffee takes forever once seated and never refilled. if you ask, you are charged...and sometimes served in a paper cup when they run out of serving cups. that is happened three times...even when i have seen clean cups at the coffee bar. the wait staff are unorganized and walk around a lot in circles and then stand and talk while prepared food sits and gets cold. we had cold food served to us twice. the wrong food was served today along with the paper coffee cups...again...with no apology, as if it is acceptable in a high-priced wannabe. when the wrong food was served, my friend finally complained and sent it back. his complaint was followed by a visit to the table by the \"owner.\" all she could muster up for service recovery was, \"thanks for the input.\"  are you kidding me? no apology...no attempt to comp coffees...even in paper cups.  what a joke. i do not know how an entrepreneur dependent on return business can afford to be so nonchalant. good luck to you and marty is whoever you are since you also failed to identify yourself.  i hate to see another strip district casualty, but this place is doomed.","food and drinks are so delicious","15$ for a coffee and an egg sandwich with bacon? if it was

really enjoyed the sandwich and noted that the french fries were really good as well. i chose to go with the steak and eggs and there was nothing i would change about my decision. the steak was a smoked tri-tip. i had never had smoked steak and i am sad it has taken this long. the meal also came with eggs, bread, potatoes that were amazingly crispy and an ample amount of chimichurri smothering the steak. i would eat this meal every day. i will note that the server was not entirely attentive and we did have to ask for cream a few times receiving it. however, i mean merely noting as the food was too good not to give the full 5 stars.","great breakfast dishes. organic and local produce suppliers. just a little long of a wait after we were seated because they seem short staffed. but it was made up for in great service afterwards.","came in for lunch/ to look at the gluten free section of the market.  i was pleasantly surprised to find a large selection of gluten free options.  i ended up having the smoked chicken sandwich and salad.  it came out with just the right crunch to the gluten free bread, a slight melt to the muenster cheese and a very nice pairing of chicken, bacon, apple and greens.  i will probably be back in the next week to try something different.","- love the layout and look of everything- bright, clean, open, modern, simple. - hubby and i went on a friday

groceries were not stocked and the menu options were limited.. did try their potato leek soup - hearty and super tasty!although their primary theme is that they will be selling locally-sourced organic produce, dairy, meat & specialty foods; it will be unfair to call this place just another grocery store. with an industrial, loft-like setting it is a hybrid of a whole foods + a coffee bar + a casual

velvet, gingerbread, and lemon creme (see photo).  what a delicious surprise!aesthetically, the cupcakes were beautiful--particularly the decorative details appropriate to each flavor placed on top of each cupcake.  in terms of flavor, the icing was excellent--very creamy, rich, and dense, dominating the cupcake in terms of amount and flavor.  the flavors really stood out--particularly the cream cheese flavor for the red velvet cupcake.  my favorites were that and the mint, though every flavor i tried was good, which surprised me given that i am generally not a huge fan of red velvet cake.  however, the cake portion of the cupcakes was not as fresh as i would like it to be, given that it was a bit crusty around the edges.*  i asked my lab manager when he would bought the cupcakes, and he said he would picked them up the day before and kept them in the refrigerator overnight, so i am not sure whether the cake portion is fresher when served. *see editrall, i thought vps did a great job

have a freshly baked cookie?\"  when i was a kid, i wanted to be like everyone else - boy was i stupid.  even though i am an \"adult\" my mom still occasionally sends me care packages with baked goods but in the months between, vanilla pastry studio really fills the void.  first, the cupcakes.  wow.  the icing melts in your mouth and is not too thick or overwhelming as with most cupcake shops.  the balance of icing and cake is perfect.  the flavors are not artificial at all, it feels like they use the best ingredients for everything.  i recently had a coconut caramel concoction that was just heaven in my mouth - the cake was light and fluffy - just like mom is but the icing was better (shhh do not tell!).  i also love the little boxes they use to package the cupcakes, perfect for uncrushed cupcake delivery.  i also got a couple of brownies for my boyfriend which he gobbled up in about three seconds - good thing i hid a turtle one and had two delectable bites of chocolate

chocolate buttercream cupcake, and i liked the hints of lemon in the frosting on my red velvet cupcake.  it was hard to choose just two.  they are, however, cheaper than dozen is cupcakes (dozen sells theirs at $Meaning to in Short Message Service.50 a pop, vanilla $Meaning to in Short Message Service.Meaning to in Short Message Service5).  just remember to handle vanilla is cupcakes carefully if you are taking them to go.  even though they were packed up nicely in a box, i managed to tip my box at some point so the box was a bit messy when i opened it.  the frosting is whipped and softer than at other places, so these cupcakes should not be tossed around (unless it is directly into your mouth).vanilla also sells some goodies pre-packed into cellophane bags and tied up with pretty ribbon--nice for a spur of the moment gift. i bought a small bag of brownie bites with peppermint cream centers.  amazing!  i do not think i am going to share these.  maybe next time.  the space is

 it is been awhile since i have had that kind of care. it is one of the pluses of doing business with a small business. one of the best things about parker is besides the customer care is that they use items like coffee and pretzels from local pittsburgh businesses. stop in and give it a try. you wo not be disappointed.","easily one of the best new sandwich shops in the pittsburgh area, calling it just a sandwich shop does not do it justice though. the have an assortment of different options you can choose from if a pretzel sandwich is not your first choice, but i would definitely recommend trying one if you have not. pretzels are always fresh and so are the items that go on top of them. the owner uses all local family owned stores to make his menu items which makes it all the more reason to keep going back. you can easily run in and grab a sandwich and coffee if you are in a hurry or to sit and hang out and talk with the owner if you want to relax a bit. i ca not wait to get back and try a new sandwich. also if you are a coffee person they have zeke is coffee which is hands down better than any starbucks i have ever been to.","a great steamed sandwich place in pgh - the steamed sandwiches are unlike any other sandwiches available in the city.  all the ingredients are local and super fresh - it is awesome to see pgh businesses support other local businesses and the community.  breakfast sandwiches are insanely affordable and delicious, and i love the pretzel buns (also local). the meatballs sandwiches are insanely good too (an old family recipe), and the meats are from butcher on butler (in lawrenceville).  also carries the best coffee in the burgh, from zeke is.  definitely worth a trip, especially to try something new.  i will be back soon!","have eaten here twice and both times it was outstanding. definitely a must try if looking for a great sandwich, hogie, or breakfast. coffee is great and the fresh squeezed lemonade is awesome","friendly fun, family run atmosphere. the homemade meatball (add pepperoni), on a pretzel bun, is as easy to eat as it is delicious. unbelievably affordable breakfast/lunch combos (vs chain competitors); with noticeably higher quality ingredients and preparation. lastly, the only steamed sandwich shop (i am aware of) in the burgh -- well worth the stop!","delicious steamed sandwiches - i almost always opt for the pretzel bun (which is local from the pretzel shop in south side).  everything i have gotten there has been tasty but some of my faves are the dillio and wakie wakie (get the pretzel bun!) i also recently had the fat boy breakfast (so good) and the dog of the day which had chili, bbq sauce and bacon on a hot dog (surprisingly awesome). try this place out - it is delicious!","great place, good coffee (zeke is), good bagel and sub type sandwiches for breakfast and lunch especially, really friendly staff.  great new place in dormont.","got a sausage, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich on a pretzel bun. the thinnest patty of sausage you have ever seen and it was not very warm. bun was dense and hard. coffee was good, though.","first, let me start out by saying that i love having a neighborhood sandwich shop again!! everything is fresh, made to order and delicious. i opted for one of their creations - \"the dillio\", which consists of turkey, bacon, avocado, (i subbed pepper jack for swiss), lettuce and tomato on a whole wheat bagel. every bite was enjoyable! employees are super friendly also!"]}}}}}}
